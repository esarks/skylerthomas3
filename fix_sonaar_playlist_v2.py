    # We need to change BOTH:

    # 2. Post: p=600 → p=2284 (for Great Faithfulness)

    # Wait - this doesn't make sense. If we're changing the MP3 to Dig-a-Little-Deeper,
    # we should keep p=600 (because that's the Dig a Little Deeper post).

    # The user wants:
    # - Dig-a-Little-Deeper.mp3 → p=600
    # - Great-is-Your-Faithfulness-Rock.mp3 → p=2284

    # So we need TWO tracks. Let me check if Great Faithfulness appears elsewhere...

    # Strategy: Replace the MP3 URL but ALSO change the post link from p=600 to p=2284
    # This will keep "Great is Your Faithfulness" in the playlist at p=2284

    # No wait, that's backwards. Let me think...

    # Current state: Great-Faithfulness-Rock.mp3 → p=600
    # Desired state: Dig-a-Little-Deeper.mp3 → p=600

    # But we also want Great-Faithfulness-Rock.mp3 to still be in the playlist at p=2284

    # So the solution is to:
    # 1. Find the track with Great-Faithfulness-Rock.mp3 and p=600
    # 2. Change MP3 to Dig-a-Little-Deeper.mp3 (keep p=600)
    # 3. ADD a NEW track with Great-Faithfulness-Rock.mp3 → p=2284

    # But that's complex. Let me try a simpler approach:
    # Change the track to point to p=2284 instead, and ADD Dig-a-Little-Deeper separately

    # Actually, the simplest is what the user said:
    # Track at p=600 should have Dig-a-Little-Deeper.mp3
    # The Great-Faithfulness track should point to p=2284 instead of p=600
