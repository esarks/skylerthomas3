# Dedication

To those still in the swamp,
who haven't yet heard the call.

To those at the water's edge,
learning what it means to be washed clean.

And to those walking in unforced rhythms,
discovering that grace is not just sufficient—
it's everything.

This is your story too.

And most important, to my loving wife and children who didn't leave me when things got at their worst. You make life pure joy.

# Out of the Swamp: How I Found Truth

## Introduction


## Who This Book Is For

Are you soul tired? The kind of tired that sleep doesn't fix.

Do you lie awake wondering if there's more than this? Do achievements feel hollow? Relationships exhausting? Does the constant striving to prove you're enough never... quite... work?

If that resonates, keep reading.

Because I've discovered another way to live. Not perfect. Not easy. But different. Better. More real.

And you don't have to figure it out alone.


## The Crash

You know that moment when you can't keep pretending anymore?

For me, it came in eight words: *"I can't do this anymore."*

Then my world crumbled.

It was more than burnout. It was moral breakdown—an unraveling of the life I'd tried to hold together. My performance-based identity collapsed. I crossed boundaries those closest to me couldn't accept. As leader, husband, father—I lost the trust that defined my identity.

What remained? Shame. Emptiness. And the desperate hope that I could still be loved.

**But here's what I discovered:**

Love meets us exactly where we are. Not where we should be. Not where we pretend to be. Exactly where we are—mud and all.

### The Years of Performance

Everything looked right from the outside. Working hard. Mentoring. Serving community. Being a good family man. People looked to me as an example.

But underneath? Relationships fracturing. Conflicts I couldn't navigate. My boss pulled me aside: the dynamic wasn't working, and I was part of the problem. At home, tension you could feel before anyone spoke.

I was trying so hard. But internally? Drowning.

Then the facade crumbled.

And the institution I'd served so faithfully? They didn't know how to handle brokenness. No resources for restoration. Only consequences. Instead of healing, I heard condemnation. Instead of compassion, rejection.

So I walked away. Into the swamp of shame, isolation, and despair.

Henri Nouwen named what I was experiencing:

> "There is a deep hole in your being, like an abyss. You will never succeed in filling that hole, because your needs are inexhaustible... Since the hole is so deep and your anguish so total, you run away from it, afraid that you will fall into it."
>
> — Henri Nouwen, *The Inner Voice of Love*

That abyss—I'd spent years trying to fill it with performance, approval, image-maintenance. But in the swamp, I was too tired to run. I had to look at it. Face what I'd been avoiding.

Maybe you can't relate to my specific story. But perhaps you know the ending: wounded to the point of wanting out. Standing in wreckage that can't be put back together.

That's where this journey begins. Not in victory, but in the swamp. Not with answers, but with honesty.


## The Songs as Waypoints

Each chapter centers on a song.

These aren't illustrations—they're the heart of it. Each song was written in a specific season, in a specific struggle, and became a waypoint on the journey. The book is the story behind the songs. The songs are the soundtrack of healing.

When you reach each chapter, listen first, read second. Let the music bypass your defenses and touch the ache directly. Then we'll unpack it together.

The ancient Psalms taught me this. They're not theological treatises set to music. They're prayers that became songs. Laments that became worship. Honest cries that became sacred text.

David didn't write about crying out in the cave. He cried out, and that cry became a psalm.

These songs are my psalms: imperfect, incomplete, but honest.

And honesty is where healing begins.


## The Wayfarer Identity

Who is a wayfarer? Someone on a journey, often weary. A pilgrim. A traveler.

Not someone who has arrived, but someone honest enough to admit they're still on the road. Not perfect, but willing to keep walking.

Wayfarers know:
- The road is long and we're not there yet
- We'll walk through swamps, deserts, and dark valleys
- We don't travel alone
- The point isn't arrival; it's learning to walk authentically
- Questions are allowed, doubt is part of the journey
- We're all just beggars telling other beggars where to find bread

One teacher describes this path:

> "The spiritual life is not a life of success but a life of faithfulness. It's not about never falling, but about getting back up. It's not about perfection, but about direction."
> — Richard Rohr, *Falling Upward*

# Out of the Swamp: How I Found Truth (Movement 1)


### MOVEMENT 1: IN THE SWAMP (The Struggle)

> "Love is closest to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit."
>
> — Ancient wisdom

The swamp is where honesty begins.

For too long, we've been taught that strength means pretending everything is fine. That integrity means wearing our best face and smiling through the pain. That acceptance is for people who've cleaned themselves up just enough to deserve it.

The swamp says: no more.

The swamp is where we finally stop performing. Where we sink to our knees in the muck and admit: I'm not okay. I'm not strong. I'm not sure I even know what I believe anymore. I'm drowning, and I don't know how to save myself.

And here's the mystery: this is exactly where healing meets us.

Not in the polished conference room. Not in the perfectly curated social media post. Not in the moment we finally get our act together.

Love meets us in the swamp.

The ancient people knew the swamp—generations of oppression and bondage. David knew it—hiding in caves, running from enemies, writing poems of lament. Job knew it—loss, broken body, friends who offered platitudes instead of presence. Jonah knew it—literal fish belly, running from truth, discovering that you can't outrun what's real.

The swamp is not the enemy. The swamp is where pretending dies so that truth can live.


**The Journey Through the Swamp:**

**Chapter 1: My Swamp** - You recognize where you are. Stuck. Sinking. No longer able to pretend you're okay. This is the moment of brutal honesty: naming the swamp for what it is, crying out for help without pretense, and choosing to step toward the water's edge even when you're terrified.

[I Will Rise](https://www.skylerthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/I-Will-Rise-Duet.mp3)

**Chapter 2: But Then I Prayed** - When self-sufficiency collapses and you finally cry out for help. Not with polished prayers, but honest desperation. "Help" is enough. This is the turning point—prayer as surrender, not strategy. The moment you reach out to what's Real.

[But Then I Prayed](https://www.skylerthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/But-then-I-Prayed-Female.mp3)

**Chapter 3: Dying Changes Everything** - Something has to die. The false self. The illusions. The control. Death feels like the end, but it's actually the beginning. Before resurrection, there must be a tomb. This is the theological hinge of transformation—the radical truth that almost dying changes nothing, but actual dying changes everything.

[Dying Changes Everything](https://www.skylerthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Dying-Changes-Everything.mp3)


## Entering This Movement

Before you begin, take a moment. **Where is your swamp?** The actual place where you're stuck right now. Name it. Be specific.

**What are you afraid to admit?** If you could be completely honest, what would you say? Practice saying it: "I'm not okay."

This chapter is about the swamp—that stuck place where you've been living. It's going to name some hard truths. And it's going to ask you to consider that the restlessness you feel might be more than random. Might be something, or Someone, calling to you.

You don't have to believe it yet. Just keep reading.


## The Geography of Disconnection

The swamp is where connection dies. From yourself. From others. From what's real and true. In the swamp, you stop asking if you're loved and start wondering if you're even lovable.

Brené Brown, whose research has explored human connection for decades, puts it this way:

> "Connection is why we're here; it is what gives purpose and meaning to our lives."
>
> — Brené Brown, *Daring Greatly*

Connection is oxygen for the soul. Cut it off long enough, and something inside you begins to suffocate.

Let's be honest about what the swamp actually is:

Dark water, murky and opaque. You can't see the way out. The muck clings to you, pulls at you. Everything feels heavy—your clothes, your limbs, your thoughts. And you can taste it in the back of your throat. Bitter. Like swallowing failure.

This isn't just depression. This is years of performing instead of being. Conversations that ricochet off walls. Connection that feels like clocking in. Community that tastes like judgment. Meaning that stopped being a gift and became a weight you can't carry anymore.


## The Collapse of Self-Sufficiency

There's a moment in every swamp journey when you hit the wall: *I can't fix this.*

Not "I don't want to fix this." Not "I shouldn't have to fix this." But the deeper, darker admission: *I am incapable. I am insufficient. I am out of moves.*

This is terrifying, especially if you're the one who always finds a way. The problem-solver. The strong one. The one others lean on. You've built your identity on competence, on handling it, on never letting them see you sweat.

And now you're drenched.

For me, it was the moment I realized: I couldn't think my way out. Couldn't work my way out. Couldn't perform my way out. I'd exhausted my toolkit. Every tool broken.

Henri Nouwen spent years at Harvard delivering polished lectures on spirituality. But it was only when he left academia to serve people with intellectual disabilities at L'Arche that he learned what he'd been teaching. In the mess. In the vulnerability. He wrote:

> "When we honestly ask ourselves which person in our lives means the most to us, we often find that it is those who, instead of giving advice, solutions, or cures, have chosen rather to share our pain and touch our wounds with a warm and tender hand."
>
> — Henri Nouwen, *Out of Solitude*

This is what the swamp teaches us: we don't need people to fix us. We need people to sit with us. To acknowledge the ache. To stop pretending they have all the answers and simply be present to the pain.

The swamp isn't punishment. It's invitation. When self-sufficiency collapses, we're faced with a choice: do we reach out, or do we keep trying to manage on our own?

## Song Lyrics: (I Will Rise)

**[Verse 1]**
I built these walls, I learned to fight,
Kept my heart locked up so tight.
Hid my fear behind a smile,
But I've been sinking all the while.

**[Pre-Chorus]**
I hear You calling through the night,
A voice so strong, yet full of light.
You pull me close, You draw me higher,
Out of the swamp, into the fire.

**[Chorus]**
I won't stay where shadows grow,
Where my heart turns cold, where the dark winds blow,
I'm stepping out, I'm choosing life,
Leaving the swamp for the morning light.
Oh, I will rise… I will rise.

**[Verse 2]**
I made a home in sinking ground,
Afraid to leave, afraid to drown.
But chains aren't homes, and wounds don't heal
When I resist the love you reveal
The fear, the shame, the weight I've known,
You call me out, You lead me home.

**[Pre-Chorus]**
I hear You calling through the night,
A voice so strong, yet full of light.
You pull me close, You draw me higher,
Out of the swamp, into the fire.

**[Chorus]**
I won't stay where shadows grow,
Where my heart turns cold, where the dark winds blow,
I'm stepping out, I'm choosing life,
Leaving the swamp for the morning light.
Oh, I will rise… I will rise.

**[Bridge]**
I see the road, I see the dawn,
And though I shake, I'll carry on.
No more hiding, no more chains,
Your grace is stronger than my pain!

**[Final Chorus]**
I won't stay where shadows grow,
Where my heart turns cold, where the dark winds blow,
I'm stepping out, I'm choosing life,
Leaving the swamp for the morning light.
Oh, I will rise… I will rise.

**[Outro]**
No turning back, I'm walking free,
The past is gone, Your love in me.
The past is gone, Your love in me.
Oh, I will rise… I will rise.


## Reflections for the Road

**Questions for the Journey:**

1. **What is your swamp?**

   Not metaphorically. Specifically. Where are you stuck? What patterns have you normalized? What pain have you learned to live with?

   Name it. Out loud if you can. In writing if you must. But name it.

2. **How long have you been defending your swamp?**

   What explanations do you give? What justifications? "It's not that bad." "Everyone struggles." "I'm handling it."

   What would happen if you stopped defending and started being honest?

3. **Who is your impostor? What mask are you wearing?**

   If they knew the real you—the doubting, struggling, messy you—what do you fear would happen?

4. **Who knows the real you—the swamp-dwelling, muck-covered, struggling you?**

   The impostor thrives in isolation. Authenticity requires witness.

   Who have you let see beneath the performance? If the answer is "no one," that's your next step.

# Out of the Swamp: How I Found Truth (Chapter 2)


### MOVEMENT 1: IN THE SWAMP (The Struggle)
### Chapter 2: But Then I Prayed

[But Then I Prayed](https://www.skylerthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/But-then-I-Prayed-Female.mp3)

**Listen at:** http://go.skylerthomas.com/swI2s8

![Scan to listen: But Then I Prayed](qr-ch02-but-then-i-prayed.png)


This chapter is about what happens when you finally run out of options. When you've tried everything and nothing works. When self-sufficiency collapses and you reach out—not with polished words, but with honest cries.

You might not call it prayer. Maybe you've never prayed before. Maybe prayer feels too religious, too formal, too... much.

That's okay. Because what I'm talking about isn't religious performance. It's honest conversation with whatever is Real, whatever is greater than yourself.

And if you're willing to consider that "whatever" might actually be Someone—that changes everything.


## Prayer as Surrender, Not Strategy

Here's what we get wrong: we treat prayer like a vending machine. Insert the right words, push the right button, and out pops the answer we want.

But swamp prayer isn't strategy. It's surrender.

Not: "God, here's my five-point plan—please bless it."

But: "I'm out of plans. I'm placing this in hands larger than mine because mine are empty."

There's a canyon-wide difference between asking *for help to accomplish our will* and asking *for the wisdom to see what's truly needed*.

The first keeps us in the director's chair. We're still writing the script; we just need assistance.

The second surrenders the pen. We acknowledge the script might look different from ours—and we're willing to trust it anyway.

Richard Foster writes:

> "Real prayer comes not from gritting our teeth but from falling in love."
>
> — Richard Foster, *Prayer: Finding the Heart's True Home*

Prayer isn't about having the right words. It's about bringing our real selves—broken, desperate, honest—before what's Real.

## Song Lyrics: But Then I Prayed

**[Verse 1]**
The night was long, the weight was strong,
The shadows whispered, "You don't belong."
I felt the fear, the dark surround,
No light, no hope, no solid ground.

**[Pre-Chorus]**
And in my sorrow, in my despair,
I found Your presence waiting there.

**[Chorus]**
But then I prayed, and You were near,
Your voice of love cast out my fear.
Your mercy came, Your grace remained,
The chains were gone—You healed my pain.
But then I prayed, but then I prayed.

**[Verse 2]**
The storms rolled in, the waves were high,
The questions burned, "Lord, why, oh why?"
My strength was gone, my faith ran dry,
Yet still I lifted up my cry.

**[Pre-Chorus]**
And in the chaos, I heard You say,
"My child, I'm here, don't turn away."

**[Chorus]**
But then I prayed, and You were near,
Your voice of love cast out my fear.
Your mercy came, Your grace remained,
The chains were gone—You healed my pain.
But then I prayed, but then I prayed.

**[Bridge]**
Mountains move, and waters part,
Your power reaches every heart.
When all seems lost, when hope is faint,
Your name alone sustains the saints.
I called to You, and You replied,
Your love restored my life inside.

**[Final Chorus]**
But then I prayed, and You were near,
Your voice of love cast out my fear.
Your mercy came, Your grace remained,
The chains were gone—You healed my pain.
But then I prayed, but then I prayed.

**[Outro]**
So I will pray through every fight,
I'll lift my song in darkest night.


## The Wayfarer Moment

**Prayer isn't about having the right words. It's about bringing our real selves—broken, desperate, honest—before whatever we call Real.**

For so long, I thought I had to pray the "right" way. Thought God was listening for spiritual maturity, unwavering faith, positive thinking. So I prayed prayers I thought were acceptable, not prayers that expressed what I actually felt.

Those prayers bounced off the ceiling.

But when I finally stopped performing and started being real—when I prayed the ugly prayers, the doubting prayers, the angry prayers, the desperate prayers—something shifted.

Not because God suddenly started listening. He had been listening all along. But because I finally started being honest.

And honesty is the language of connection.

C.S. Lewis writes:

> "We must lay before Him what is in us, not what ought to be in us."
>
> — C.S. Lewis, *Letters to Malcolm: Chiefly on Prayer*

Reality doesn't need our pretense. It already knows the truth. What it wants is for us to know it—and to speak it.

The swamp teaches us to reach out without pretense. To cry out without composing. To pour out our souls without editing.

And when we do, we discover something astonishing: this is the conversation that's been waiting all along.

Not the polished one. The real one.


## Reflections for the Road

**Questions for the Journey:**

1. **When do you typically turn to prayer—first or last?**

   Be honest. Do you reach out when life is smooth, or only when you've exhausted every other option?

   What would it look like to make honest conversation your first response instead of your last resort?

2. **What does your "prayer voice" sound like?**

   Is it formal? Polished? Theological? Or is it raw, honest, unfiltered?

   What would change if you prayed like you talk to your closest friend—without editing, without performing, without pretending?

3. **What would you lose if you stopped performing "acceptable" prayers?**

   What part of your prayer life is for God, and what part is maintaining an image—for yourself or others?

4. **How will you practice honest prayer this week?**

   Name one specific thing you'll stop editing out. One fear you'll name. One doubt you'll confess. One desperate need you'll actually admit.

# Out of the Swamp: How I Found Truth (Chapter 3)


### MOVEMENT 1: IN THE SWAMP (The Struggle)
### Chapter 3: Dying Changes Everything

[Dying Changes Everything](https://www.skylerthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Dying-Changes-Everything.mp3)

**Listen at:** http://go.skylerthomas.com/7U8VKi

![Scan to listen: Dying Changes Everything](qr-ch04-dying-changes.png)


**An Invitation to Consider**

You've named the swamp. You've prayed—even if it was just "Help." You've made a decision to keep walking this journey.

But here's what nobody tells you at the beginning: deciding to leave the swamp means something in you has to die.

Not physically. But the version of you that's been surviving in the muck. The coping mechanisms you've relied on. The illusions about how life works.

## Key Themes

### 1. Death as Transformation

Death in spiritual literature is rarely just biological cessation. It's transformation. Passage. Transition.

Here are the different kinds of death we experience:
- Death to the false self - the person we've performed being, not who we actually are
- Death to illusions - the stories we've told ourselves about how life should work
- Death to control - the grip we've held on outcomes, other people, our futures
- Death to the life we planned so we can live the life that's actually here

Dallas Willard says:

> "The greatest issue facing the world today is whether those who are identified as 'Christians' will become disciples—students, apprentices, practitioners—of Jesus Christ, steadily learning from him how to live the life of the Kingdom."
>
> — Dallas Willard, *The Great Omission*

The death of my performance felt like the death of myself. I'd poured everything into it—my identity, my worth, my purpose. When it crumbled under the weight of my own moral failure, I didn't know who I was. Would I lose my family? Would I lose my job? Would I lose my purpose?

My moral decay didn't just end a chapter of my life. It severed me from the community I'd grown so close to. The people who knew me, trusted me, looked to me—gone. Not because they abandoned me, but because my choices had consequences. Real, devastating, life-altering consequences. And greater, it threatened my marriage.

I remember the night I finally admitted it was over. The community I'd built. The reputation I'd cultivated. The leader I'd pretended to be.

All of it—dead.

But here's what I didn't understand then: God wasn't destroying me out of anger. Life was dismantling the false version of me I'd built. Killing the performer who wore my success like a costume. Killing my addiction to approval, to respect, to being seen as the "good" one.

The false self had to die so the true self could begin to live.

### 2. What Must Die: The False Self

Richard Rohr contrasts the true self (the person you were created to be) with the false self (the person you think you need to be to survive, to be loved, to matter):

> "There is nothing to prove and nothing to protect. I am who I am and it's enough."
>
> — Richard Rohr, *Immortal Diamond*

The false self is built on what people expect, what earns approval, what feels safe, what maintains control.

The false self says: "If people knew the real me, they'd reject me." "I have to perform to be loved." "Vulnerability is weakness." "I am what I accomplish."

Thomas Merton understood this deeply:

> "Every one of us is shadowed by an illusory person: a false self. This is the man I want myself to be but who cannot exist, because God does not know anything about him."
>
> — Thomas Merton, *New Seeds of Contemplation*

You're not losing yourself. You're losing the prison you've been living in.

| **The False Self** | **The True Self** |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Performs for approval | Rests in acceptance |
| Fears exposure | Practices honesty |
| Hides weakness | Confesses need |
| Image-management | Authenticity |
| Exhausting | Life-giving |

### 3. Dying to Control, Certainty, Performance

Control is one of the hardest things to surrender. We want to manage outcomes. Predict futures. Protect ourselves from pain.

Certainty is another. We want answers, not mysteries. Clear paths, not ambiguity.

Performance is how we try to earn what life offers freely: acceptance, love, belonging.

All three have to die.

**Dying to Control:**

The death of control feels like freefall. But it's not. It's falling into the arms of what's been holding you all along—the reality that you were never actually in control, and that's okay.

**Dying to Certainty:**

This is hard because we've been taught doubt is weakness. But clinging to certainty is the opposite of faith. Real trust requires living in the midst of mystery.

The death of false certainty opens space for a bigger, truer understanding of reality.

**Dying to Performance:**

You can't earn love. You can't perform your way to acceptance. Every effort to prove yourself is just another attempt at self-justification that exhausts your soul.

Brennan Manning exposed this trap:

> "My deepest awareness of myself is that I am deeply loved by Jesus Christ and I have done nothing to earn it or deserve it."
>
> — Brennan Manning, *The Ragamuffin Gospel*

The death of performance means you stop. You rest. You receive. You let yourself be loved not because you're impressive, but because you're human.

### 4. Why Resurrection Requires a Tomb

You can't be raised unless you've died. You can't experience transformation unless you've been in the darkness.

Between death and resurrection, there's a tomb. Dark. Silent. Seemingly final. And most of us are terrified of that in-between space.

We want instant transformation: decision one moment, new life the next. We want to skip the tomb. But there's no resurrection without burial.

C.S. Lewis understood this paradox:

> "Give up your self, and you will find your real self. Lose your life and you will save it. Submit to death, death of your ambitions and favourite wishes every day and death of your whole body in the end: submit with every fibre of your being, and you will find eternal life. Keep back nothing. Nothing that you have not given away will ever be really yours. Nothing in you that has not died will ever be raised from the dead."
>
> — C.S. Lewis, *Mere Christianity*

This is the hardest part: living in the tomb. You've let the old self die. The false identity is gone. The illusions are shattered. The performance has stopped.

But the new self hasn't emerged yet. You're in the darkness, waiting. And you don't know how long the darkness will last.

Most of us experience transformation this way: We've experienced death—of dreams, relationships, certainties, selves—and we're waiting in the tomb. We know about resurrection theoretically, but we're living in the tomb emotionally.

The darkness is part of the journey. You can't skip it. You can't rush it. You have to go through it.

But here's the promise: the tomb is not the end. It never was. It's the passage between who you were and who you're becoming.

*What version of yourself needs to die so your true self can emerge?*

## The Wayfarer Moment

**You can't be resurrected until you're willing to die. Transformation requires surrender of the self we've been protecting.**

This is the scariest wayfarer moment yet. Because death feels like loss. Like failure. Like the end.

But the wayfarer learns: Death is passage. The tomb isn't the end; it's the womb of new life. What feels like dying is actually being born.

## Key Takeaways

- **Almost dying changes nothing; dying changes everything.** Partial surrender keeps you in the swamp with a different view. Complete death to the false self is what resurrection requires.
- **The tomb is not the end—it's passage.** Saturday's darkness between death and resurrection is where trust is tested. You can't skip the waiting, but the waiting isn't wasted.
- **What dies stays dead.** Don't resuscitate old patterns, false identities, or survival mechanisms. Let what needs to die remain buried so new life can emerge.
- **You can't resurrect yourself.** Transformation isn't self-improvement—it's being made alive by God's power. Your job is to surrender; His job is to raise you.

# Out of the Swamp: How I Found Truth (Movement 2)


### MOVEMENT 2: AT THE WATER'S EDGE (The Turning)

> "On the last day, the climax of the festival, Jesus stood and shouted to the crowds, 'Anyone who is thirsty may come to me! Anyone who believes in me may come and drink! For the Scriptures declare, "Rivers of living water will flow from his heart."'"
>
> — John 7:37-38 (NLT)


You've left the swamp.

It wasn't easy. Your feet are heavy with swamp mud. Your clothes are soaked. You smell like the muck you just escaped.

But you're here. At the water's edge.

This is liminal space. The in-between. Not swamp anymore, but not healed yet either. Not drowning, but not dancing. Not death, but not resurrection. Not Friday, not Sunday.

This is Saturday. Tomb time. Transition.

The water's edge is where grace does its most subversive work.

You want to clean yourself up before you step into the water. You're embarrassed by the mud, the stench, the evidence of where you've been. Surely you need to get yourself together first, right?

Wrong.

Grace says: Come as you are. Mud and all. Shame and all. Questions and all.

The water isn't there to judge you. It's there to wash you.

But here's the hard part: You have to let yourself be washed. You have to get in the water. You have to let grace touch the wounds.

And that's terrifying.

Because what if you're too dirty? What if the water rejects you? What if grace has limits and you've exceeded them?

These chapters—4 through 7—are about discovering the answer to those fears. And the answer is always the same: Grace is deeper than your shame. Wider than your failure. Stronger than your sin. More persistent than your doubt.


**The Journey at the Water's Edge:**

**Chapter 4: Living Waters Edge** - You stand at the edge of the water, filthy from the swamp, convinced you have to clean yourself up before you can approach. But grace invites you to come as you are. The water doesn't recoil—it receives you. This is the scandalous truth: you don't clean yourself up to receive grace. You receive grace to be cleaned.

**Chapter 5: In the Shadow of Your Grace** - In the desert of transition, you discover that grace isn't just rescue from the pit—it's shelter in the wilderness. The shadow doesn't remove the sun; it provides covering under it. You learn the difference between hiding FROM truth and hiding IN truth. And you discover that the shadow proves the light is real.

**Chapter 6: Amazing Grace I Did Receive** - You stand at the water's edge covered in the consequences of your choices—the shame of trampling on grace, the grave of autonomy, the dead-end road of self-rule. And you hear the whisper: "Amazing grace, that saved a wretch like me." Grace is scandalous precisely because it's for those who don't deserve it. And when you step toward the water, you feel Love's hand lifting you from the grave.

**Chapter 7: Dig a Little Deeper** - The surface mud is washing away, but underneath is scar tissue—layers of protection, coping mechanisms, wounds you've been medicating for years. Real healing requires going deeper. Excavating through performance, shame, wounds, and false beliefs until you hit bedrock truth: You are loved. You are worthy. You are enough. And grace goes all the way down.

## Entering This Movement

Before you wade into these four chapters, pause here at the water's edge.

**Look back at the swamp.**

You've come through Movement 1. You got honest. You named the swamp. You cried out. You let something die.

That took courage. Real courage. Not the kind that pretends to be strong, but the kind that admits weakness.

**Look at where you are now.**

You're at the edge of the water. Still carrying the mud from the swamp. Still smelling like the muck you just escaped. Still a little shaky.

You're in liminal space. The in-between. Not swamp anymore, but not healed yet either.

This is uncomfortable. Liminal space always is. Because you're between identities—no longer who you were, not yet who you're becoming.

But this is also sacred space. Because this is where grace does its most transforming work.

**What this movement requires:**

Movement 1 required honesty. You had to stop pretending and get real about the swamp.

Movement 2 requires receptivity. You have to let yourself be washed, held, healed. You have to receive what you can't earn.

Everything in you wants to clean yourself up first. To prove you're worthy of grace. To do something to deserve the healing.

But grace doesn't work that way. Grace says: Come as you are. Receive what you can't earn. Let yourself be loved.

Can you step into the water without trying to clean yourself up first?

Can you receive grace even though you don't deserve it?

Can you let yourself be known—really known, mud and all—and still believe you're loved?

That's the work of Movement 2.

**The woman at the well knew this.**

She came to draw water at noon—the hottest time of day, when nobody else would be there. She was hiding from judgment, carrying shame from five failed marriages.

And she met Someone who offered "living water." She tried to deflect. To avoid being fully known.

But He kept bringing her back to the truth: I see you. All of you. And I'm offering you living water anyway.

Being truly known and truly loved—that's what she discovered at the well.

That's what you're about to discover at the water's edge.

**One question before you begin:**

Are you willing to be known?

Not the version of yourself you present to the world. But the real you. The one who's been hiding. The one who's afraid of being rejected. The one who's convinced there's not enough grace.

Are you willing to let grace see all of that? And trust that it's enough?

If you are—even tentatively, even uncertainly—then you're ready.

The water is here. The invitation is extended. Grace is waiting.

*Wade in. One step at a time. The water's not going to hurt you. It's going to heal you.*

*When you're ready, turn to Chapter 4: Living Waters Edge.*

# Out of the Swamp: How I Found Truth (Chapter 4)

## A Prayer of Invitation

You've walked through the swamp. You've named it. You've cried out for help. You've learned that something has to die.

And now you're here. At the water's edge.

Maybe this is the moment. The moment when you stop spinning in circles and start walking straight. When you stop analyzing and start trusting. When you make the decision to let God in—not just to your thoughts, but to your soul.

If you're ready—even if you're scared, even if you're uncertain—you can pray this prayer right now. Out loud or in your heart. Perfectly worded or stumbling through. It doesn't matter. What matters is that you mean it.

*"God, I need You. I can't do this on my own anymore. I've tried, and I'm exhausted. I'm stuck in this swamp, and I don't know the way out.*

*I believe You're real—or at least, I want to believe. Help me with my unbelief.*

*I'm sorry for the ways I've pushed You away, for trying to run my own life, for making a mess of things. I know I can't fix this by myself.*

*Jesus, I believe You came for people like me—broken, messy, stuck. I believe You died so I could be forgiven and live a new life. I accept that gift. I receive Your grace.*

*Come into my life. Come into my soul. Fill me with Your Spirit. Teach me to hear Your voice. Lead me out of this swamp and into the life You have for me.*

*I'm willing to follow, even when I don't understand. I'm willing to trust, even when I'm afraid. I'm choosing You—today, right now.*

*Thank You for not giving up on me. Thank You for meeting me here, in the mess. I'm Yours. Amen."*


## What Is Grace?

We've been using this word a lot. Grace. It sounds religious, doesn't it? Like something that belongs in stained-glass windows and hymns.

But grace isn't religious. Grace is real.

**Grace is the gift you can't earn.** Everything in our world operates on exchange. You work, you get paid. You perform, you get approval. Grace breaks that economy completely. Grace says: "I'm giving you something you didn't earn, don't deserve, and can never pay back. And I'm giving it freely, fully, without strings attached."

**Grace is love without conditions.** Maybe you've spent your whole life trying to earn love. Be good enough. Smart enough. Successful enough. Grace doesn't work that way. Grace looks at you covered in swamp mud and says, "I love you. Right now. Exactly as you are."

**Grace is power that transforms.** Grace doesn't just accept you as you are—it makes you new. The water doesn't require you to be clean before you step in. But it also doesn't leave you dirty once you're in it. It washes. It cleanses. It transforms.

Grace meets you exactly where you are. But it loves you too much to leave you there.

**Why do you need grace?** Because you're human. You're broken. You're thirsty for something that nothing in this world can satisfy. You're stuck in patterns you can't break. You're exhausted from performing.

Grace is for the broken, the thirsty, the stuck, the exhausted.

Grace is for you.


## The Threshold

There's a moment between leaving and arriving that feels impossible.

You've left the swamp—cried out for help, let something die, taken the first steps. But you haven't arrived anywhere yet. You're in the liminal space. The threshold. The water's edge.

Behind you: everything you've known. The familiar toxicity. The adaptive survival patterns.

Ahead of you: the unknown. Clean water that both attracts and terrifies you.

And here's what makes this moment so hard: the swamp is still on you. You can smell it on your clothes. Feel the dried mud cracking on your skin. You've left, but you're not yet clean. You've chosen freedom, but you're not yet free.

This is the water's edge—where decision meets transformation. Where leaving meets arriving. Where the old is passing away but the new hasn't yet fully come.

And the question that haunts you: Can I really step into that clean water looking like this?

Part of you wants to clean up first. Get yourself together. Become worthy of the gift before you receive it.

But there's no pre-water ritual. No "get yourself ready first" station.

Just the water. And you. And the invitation.


## The Core Scripture

Centuries before Jesus, a prophet spoke this invitation:

> "Is anyone thirsty? Come and drink—even if you have no money! Come, take your choice of wine or milk—it's all free!"
>
> — Isaiah 55:1 (NLT)

Come thirsty, desperate, empty-handed. Not "pay first." Not "earn it." Just come. The water is free and waiting.

And there's another invitation, spoken by Jesus at a festival in Jerusalem:

> "On the last day, the climax of the festival, Jesus stood and shouted to the crowds, 'Anyone who is thirsty may come to me! Anyone who believes in me may come and drink! For the Scriptures declare, "Rivers of living water will flow from his heart."'"
>
> — John 7:37-38 (NLT)

**"Anyone who is thirsty may come to me":** Not anyone who's good enough. Not anyone who's cleaned up. Anyone who's thirsty. Are you thirsty? Then you qualify. That's the only requirement: thirst.

**"Anyone who believes in me may come and drink":** Come to Me. Jesus. Person. Presence. The source of living water. And drink. Receive. Stop trying to earn it and just receive it.

**"Rivers of living water will flow from his heart":** Not a trickle. Rivers. Not scarcity—abundance. Not external only. From within—internal transformation that flows outward. You don't just get washed on the outside. You become a source of living water yourself.

The invitation stands: "Anyone who is thirsty may come to me! Anyone who believes in me may come and drink!"

Come to the water's edge. Come as you are—muddy, ashamed, broken, desperate. Come thirsty. And drink.


## Song Integration

Standing at Lake Hefner's boat ramp that April morning, I was at the end of myself. The boat ramp descends into the lake, pavement giving way to water—a threshold between termination and transformation. The road I'd been traveling—self-sufficiency, performance, earning worthiness—had run out.

"Living Water's Edge" emerges from the tension between two biblical realities: our profound unworthiness and God's scandalous willingness to make us whole anyway. This isn't a song about people who stumbled slightly. This is about people "burdened down by guilt and shame, no hope to be relieved"—the terminally stuck, the chronically unworthy, those who've given up hope that miracles are for them.

The opening verse asks: "Have you longed for a miracle, felt unworthy to believe?" This is the honest cry of someone who's watched God move in other lives while convinced they're somehow disqualified. But then the verse pivots with devastating grace: "Jesus stands with arms wide open, He's the Savior of your soul." Not "Jesus will open His arms once you prove yourself." Jesus *stands*—present tense, already positioned—with arms *wide open*. The posture precedes the person's arrival. The welcome exists before the worthiness.

The chorus declares: "Come and drink the living water, let it wash your fear away." This references John 7:37-38—Jesus's invitation to the thirsty. Notice what the water washes away: fear. Not just guilt, but the fear underneath—fear of rejection, exposure, fear that we're unlovable at the core. "Jesus breaks the chains that bind you; He's your miracle today." Not "might break" or "will consider." He *breaks* them. Present tense. And He's your miracle *today*—not someday, not after you've earned it. Today.

The bridge intensifies: "Have you felt the weight of sorrow, like a chain you cannot break?" This is learned helplessness—you've tried so many times to change that you've given up trying. But into this darkness: "Jesus sees your every struggle, and He whispers, 'You are Mine.'" Not "You'll be Mine if you fix yourself." *You are Mine.* Present possession. The claim precedes the change.

This song became my declaration that I was wrong about grace. Grace *is* for me. Miracles *are* for me. Not because I earned them, but because Jesus stands with arms wide open and says, "You are Mine." The living water's edge isn't for the worthy. It's for the thirsty.


## Key Takeaways

- **You don't clean up to receive grace; grace cleans you up.** The water doesn't recoil from your mud—it washes it away. Come as you are, covered in swamp, and let the living water do what only it can do.
- **Grace is scandalously free—and that's the point.** You can't earn it, deserve it, or repay it. It's a gift for the thirsty, the broken, the stuck, and the exhausted—which means it's for you.
- **Being fully known and fully loved is possible.** The woman at the well discovered that Jesus sees everything and still offers living water. Transparency isn't rejection—it's the doorway to real relationship.
- **The threshold is where obedience meets miracle.** You have to get your feet wet before the water parts. Trust doesn't wait for risk to disappear—it steps in while the risk is real.


## Closing Image

You're standing in the water now. Not all the way in—just ankles deep. Just enough to feel it's real. Cool and shocking and clean.

The mud from the swamp is starting to wash away. Not instantly. Not all at once. But gradually. With each step deeper, more of it lifts off. Carried downstream by the current.

You look down at your feet. You can see them through the water. Clear. The stones beneath them smooth and solid.

You cup water and pour it over your arms. Watch the mud run off in brown streams. Underneath: skin. Your actual skin.

You're still a mess. You're still covered in swamp. But you're also being washed. Both are true at the same time.

This is the water's edge. Not instant transformation. The beginning of transformation. Not immediate perfection. The start of healing.

You take another step. The water rises to your knees. Colder. Stronger current. But also... invigorating. Alive.

You're wading in. One step at a time. Letting the water do what you could never do for yourself.

And somewhere deep inside, beneath the shame and the fear and the exhaustion, something stirs. Something that feels almost like... hope.

Not the fragile, easily crushed hope you've known before. But something sturdier. Something rooted not in your ability to clean yourself up, but in the water's ability to wash you.

Living water.

You're at the water's edge. And you're wading in. And it's the beginning of everything.

# Out of the Swamp: How I Found Truth (Chapter 5)


### MOVEMENT 2: AT THE WATER'S EDGE (The Turning)
### Chapter 5: In the Shadow of Your Grace

[In the Shadow of Your Grace](https://www.skylerthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Shadow-of-Your-Grace-Duet.mp3)

**Listen at:** http://go.skylerthomas.com/wqg9eX

![Scan to listen: In the Shadow of Your Grace](qr-ch06-shadow-grace.png)



Have you ever been disappointed that healing didn't look the way you expected?

You thought getting out of the swamp meant the hard part was over. You thought grace would whisk you away to some peaceful place where everything would finally be easy.

But here you are. You've been washed. You've stepped into the water. You've felt grace begin its work.

And you're discovering that there's still a journey ahead. Still hard terrain. Still scorching days and uncertain paths.

Maybe you're wondering: *Is this all there is? Did I leave the swamp just to end up in a desert?*

I've been there. And here's what I learned: Grace doesn't always look like escape. Sometimes grace looks like shelter.


## Hiding IN God vs. Hiding FROM God

There are two kinds of hiding. Understanding the difference changes everything.

**Hiding FROM** is what the first humans did after they failed. Fear-driven. Shame-motivated. Trying to avoid being seen, known, exposed. This hiding isolates us, deepens our wounds, keeps us from the very healing we need.

**Hiding IN** is what ancient poets described in their prayers. Trust-driven. Safety-seeking. Running toward shelter for covering, not away in fear. This hiding heals, restores, connects us to our true identity.

The original writing from the blog captures this journey:

*"What can wash away my shame, or will I live forever in its grip, squeezing the very life out of my soul, leaving me to rot on the heap of humanity? Have I walked too far beyond the boundary of grace, only to look back and see nothing but emptiness?"*

This is the voice of someone hiding FROM. Convinced they've gone too far. Believing grace has limits.

But then the shift:

*"But then I stop. I don't move in any direction. I bow down and listen. And I hear Your voice—just the whisper of Your voice—pleading with me to return, to simply turn around and walk."*

From hiding FROM to hiding IN. From running away to turning around. From isolation to invitation.

In the shadow of grace, we don't hide our shame—we bring it into the light of covering. We don't pretend we're okay—we admit we're not and find that the shadow is big enough to cover all of it.

Hiding IN is a practice—a lifelong habit of running toward shelter, not away from it. We learn to live in the shadow now so that we know where home is when the final shadow falls.


## Shadow as Evidence of Light

Here's the theological richness we often miss: shadow is proof of light.

You can't have shadow without a light source. The deeper the shadow, the brighter the light casting it. So when we talk about dwelling in the shadow of grace, we're acknowledging something profound: *Reality itself is the light.*

> "The LORD is my light and my salvation—so why should I be afraid? The LORD is my fortress, protecting me from danger, so why should I tremble?"
>
> — Psalm 27:1 (NLT)

The shadow isn't absence of light—it's the shape light makes when it encounters the substance of divine presence. We rest in that shadow, and in doing so, we're closer to the light than we've ever been.

In the swamp, we couldn't see the light. The muck blocked it out.

At the water's edge, we discover the shadow. We're not yet walking fully in the light, but we're covered by it.

The shadow proves the light is real, present, strong enough to shelter us.


## Images of Shadow

**Ruth Under Boaz's Wing**

Ruth was a Moabite widow in a foreign land—no husband, no security, no legal protection. She gleaned in the harvest fields, working from sunrise, gathering scraps to keep herself and Naomi from starving. She was vulnerable. Exposed. A foreign woman alone.

Then Boaz, the field owner, noticed her and spoke this blessing:

> "May the LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge, reward you fully for what you have done."
>
> — Ruth 2:12 (NLT)

Ruth had left everything to come under the wing-shadow of Yahweh. She sought shelter in the God of Israel even though she had no guarantee He would provide.

And what happens? God provides through Boaz. Protects her. Covers her. Redeems her story completely—she becomes part of the lineage of King David and Jesus Himself.

Shadow grace doesn't promise comfort or ease. But it promises covering. And under that covering, redemption happens.

**The Cloud in the Wilderness**

When God led Israel out of Egypt into the wilderness, He didn't remove the wilderness. The desert was still scorching hot by day, bitter cold at night.

But God didn't leave them exposed:

> "By day the LORD went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud to guide them on their way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light."
>
> — Exodus 13:21

The cloud wasn't just navigation—it was mercy. Protection. Visible, tangible proof that God was present, leading, sheltering. In the scorching wilderness, that shadow meant the difference between survival and death.

God didn't teleport them to the promised land. He walked them through the wilderness, step by step. But He never left them exposed. The shadow of His presence covered them every single day.

**Jesus' Longing**

Perhaps the most heartbreaking image comes from Jesus Himself:

> "Jerusalem, Jerusalem... how often I have longed to gather you together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing."
>
> — Matthew 23:37

When danger comes, the mother hen doesn't run. She spreads her wings and calls her chicks to safety beneath her. She covers them with her own body, willing to take the blow herself.

This is the heart of God. Longing to gather us. Aching to cover us. Willing to take the wounds so we can be sheltered.

The shadow is there. The wings are spread. Will we come?


## Song Integration

Standing in full sunlight at the height of my spiritual crisis, I wasn't basking in illumination—I was burning from exposure. Every wound visible. Every failure on display. This is the paradox the comfortable never understand: sometimes the problem isn't darkness. Sometimes the problem is too much light—too much exposure, too much harsh truth without any corresponding shelter.

"In the Shadow of Your Grace" emerged from that scorched place. From discovering what I needed wasn't escape from reality but shelter within it.

Western Christianity tends to emphasize victory, breakthrough, deliverance—mountains moved, trials removed, circumstances changed. But more often in the actual lived experience of faithful people, God doesn't remove the trial. He provides presence within it. Not escape, but shelter. Not deliverance from, but companionship through.

Psalm 91 establishes this theology: "Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty." *Dwelling*—not visiting, not dropping by in crisis, but making your home. The psalm doesn't promise the absence of "the terror of night" or "the arrow that flies by day." These threats are real and present. The promise is covering, not elimination.

This is the scandal modern Christianity often tries to soften: following Jesus doesn't guarantee exemption from suffering. It guarantees we won't suffer alone.

The song tracks a transformation: from fear-based hiding to faith-based hiding. From running away to running toward. "I've been running, I've been hiding, worn out from the fight." This is Genesis 3 hiding—afraid of being seen. When shame drives hiding, we hide *from* exposure because we believe being fully known means being fully rejected.

But the song pivots: "But You call my name, You take the weight, You step right into my mistake." God doesn't wait at a safe distance for us to clean up. He steps *into* the mistake. Into the mess. "You tear the veil, You light the way"—referencing the temple veil torn at Christ's crucifixion (Matthew 27:51).

The chorus declares: "Oh, in the shadow of Your grace, every fear begins to fade." Not "instantly disappears" but "begins to fade." Shadow grace is a process. "Where mercy meets me face to face, I am free, I'm not the same!" This is the paradox: in the shadow, somehow we're face to face. The shadow isn't distance from the light source—it's proximity to it. You can only be in someone's shadow if you're close enough to be covered by them.

The shadow of grace teaches crucial truths: Proximity matters more than circumstances. Shelter is a form of deliverance—not from the circumstance but from facing it alone. And the shadow is evidence of light, not absence of it. In that shadow, transformation happens. Not because you're striving but because you're dwelling.


## Key Takeaways

- **Grace shelters, not just rescues.** God doesn't always remove the trial, but He covers you through it. The shadow doesn't eliminate the sun—it provides protection under it.
- **Hide IN God, not FROM God.** Running toward shelter is faith; running from exposure is fear. Bring your shame into the shadow of grace where it's covered, not hidden.
- **Shadow is proof of light.** You can't have shadow without a light source. Resting in God's shadow means you're closer to His presence than you've ever been.
- **Dwelling is different from visiting.** Psalm 91 invites you to live in the shelter, not just stop by in crisis. Make presence your primary residence, not your emergency contact.


## Closing Image

You're still at the water's edge. The journey isn't over. There's more road ahead, more wilderness to cross, more unknowns to face.

But something has changed.

You're no longer running from the sun. You're resting in the shadow.

The heat is still real. The sun still beats down. The journey is still hard.

But over you, sheltering you, covering you, is the shadow of the Almighty.

*Take a breath.*

You look up and see the source of the shadow: Love itself, standing between you and the scorching trial. Not removing it, but covering you through it.

And you realize: this is enough. Not what you wanted, perhaps. But enough.

The shadow proves the light is real.

And where there's light, there's the One who is Light.

So you breathe. You rest. You trust.

And you take the next step, knowing you're not walking alone. The shadow moves with you. The covering remains. The presence never leaves.

You're learning to live in the shadow of grace.

And in that shadow, you're finding something you didn't expect: not escape from the wilderness, but peace within it.

Not the absence of trial, but the presence of Love in trial.

Not the end of the journey, but the strength to keep walking.

One step at a time.

Under His wings.

In the shadow of grace.

# Out of the Swamp: How I Found Truth (Chapter 6)


### MOVEMENT 2: AT THE WATER'S EDGE (The Turning)
### Chapter 6: Amazing Grace I Did Receive

[Amazing Grace](https://www.skylerthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Amazing-Grace-Female-Remastered.mp3)

**Listen at:** http://go.skylerthomas.com/UCBWc5

![Scan to listen: Amazing Grace](qr-ch07-amazing-grace.png)


You've walked through several chapters now. You've named the swamp, cried out, died to the old, stepped into the water, and discovered grace shelters you.

But here's a question that might make you uncomfortable:

**Do you really believe grace is actually for you?**

Because if you're honest, part of you is still keeping score. Still calculating whether you've done enough, been good enough to deserve what you're receiving.

Part of you is still trying to earn it.

And that's the problem. Because what comes next can't be earned. Can't be deserved. Can't be worked for.

It can only be received.

Grace says: "You're getting this for free, and there's nothing you can do about it." No performance required. No goodness quota. Just... receiving.

**Can you let go of trying to deserve it? Can you simply open your hands and receive what's being freely given?**

This is harder than it sounds. Because receiving grace means admitting you're the kind of person who needs it. Not someone mostly good who stumbled. But someone who absolutely doesn't deserve it.

A wretch, in fact.

And grace says: "That's exactly who this is for."

*Can you say, even if it feels scandalous: "God, I don't deserve this. I can't earn it. But I'm opening my hands to receive it anyway. Amazing grace—for a wretch like me."*


## The Scandal of Grace: For the Undeserving

Grace is scandalous precisely because it's for people who don't deserve it. If you deserved it, it wouldn't be grace—it would be payment. A transaction.

But grace isn't a transaction. It's a gift. Freely given to those who can never earn it, never repay it, never deserve it.

This offends us. Because we've been trained to believe you get what you earn. Work hard, get rewarded. Mess up, face consequences.

But grace shatters that entire system.

> "God saved you by his grace when you believed. And you can't take credit for this; it is a gift from God. Salvation is not a reward for the good things we have done, so none of us can boast about it."
>
> — Ephesians 2:8-9 (NLT)

Not by works. Not by trying harder. By grace. Through faith. A gift.

There's a story about a prophet who received a clear call from God but fled in the opposite direction. He thought he could outrun God, create his own path. This is our human condition—we hear what's true, but we think we know better. We convince ourselves that our version of freedom will bring fulfillment.

That path led him into the belly of a fish, trapped in the very darkness he'd been trying to escape. In that belly, in that darkness, he cried out from the grave of his own making.

And God answered.

That's the scandal. God doesn't wait for us to deserve rescue. He rescues us while we're still in the belly of the whale.

Philip Yancey writes:

> "Grace is the most dangerous, revolutionary, unexpected, and free force the world has ever seen or will ever see."
>
> — Philip Yancey, *What's So Amazing About Grace?*

Grace is dangerous precisely because it refuses to play by our rules. It doesn't wait for worthiness. It doesn't demand payment. It just gives—freely, scandalously, outrageously.


## From the Grave to the Water's Edge

The progression in the writing:

- *"The freedom I was living / Turned out to make me a slave"*
- *"Rather than bringing life to me / It buried me in my own grave"*
- *"He led me down a dead end path / So He could show me His vision"*
- *"It stopped way short of the water of life / And I had to make a decision"*

God doesn't usually intervene the moment we start running. He lets us run. Lets the path we've chosen reveal its true nature. Lets us reach the dead end.

Not because He's cruel. Because that's when we're finally ready to listen.

As long as we think our path might work, we won't turn around. But when we hit the wall, when the road dead-ends—that's when grace becomes not just nice but necessary.

And at that dead end, there's a choice: turn around or stay buried.

The water of life is right there. Close enough to see. But there's a gap between the dead-end road and the water's edge. And crossing that gap requires a decision.


## The Lifting: God's Hand Raises Us

*"With each step I took, I felt His hand / Lifting me out of my grave"*

This is the miracle. We step toward the water, and God's hand meets us. We take one step of faith, and He carries us the rest of the way.

We don't pull ourselves out of the grave. We can't.

But when we trust—when we simply turn toward the water and step—God's hand reaches down and lifts us out.

> "But God is so rich in mercy, and he loved us so much, that even though we were dead because of our sins, he gave us life when he raised Christ from the dead. (It is only by God's grace that you have been saved!)"
>
> — Ephesians 2:4-5 (NLT)

Made us alive. Not "helped us get a little better." Made us alive.

That's resurrection language. That's grace language.


## The Prodigal Son: From the Pigpen to the Father's Embrace

Jesus told a story about a younger son who demanded his inheritance early (essentially wishing his father dead), left home, squandered everything, and ended up in a pigpen, so desperate he's eating pig food.

From that pigpen, he makes a decision:

> "I will go home to my father and say, 'Father, I have sinned against both heaven and you, and I am no longer worthy of being called your son. Please take me on as a hired servant.'"
>
> — Luke 15:18-19 (NLT)

He's not expecting grace. He's expecting to be a servant at best. He's rehearsing his speech, his offer to earn his way back.

But watch what happens:

> "So he returned home to his father. And while he was still a long way off, his father saw him coming. Filled with love and compassion, he ran to his son, embraced him, and kissed him."
>
> — Luke 15:20 (NLT)

The father doesn't wait for the apology. Doesn't wait for the son to grovel. While the son is still far off, the father runs.

When the son tries to give his speech, the father cuts him off. He calls for the best robe, a ring, sandals. He throws a party.

This is scandalous grace. The son deserves nothing. He's squandered everything. He's come home smelling like pigs. But the father doesn't care about what he deserves. The father cares about who he is: his son.

Grace isn't based on worthiness. It's based on relationship.

Henri Nouwen writes:

> "The father's love is unconditional... There are no 'ifs.' The love of the father is given, not as the reward for effort, but as a pure gift. The younger son did not deserve that love... But the father gives it anyway."
>
> — Henri Nouwen, *The Return of the Prodigal Son*

The son comes home to be a servant. The father makes him a son. That's grace.


## Song Integration

The first time I truly understood John Newton's "Amazing Grace," I was standing at a dead end of my own making, and the word "wretch" suddenly stopped being offensive and started being honest.

To understand this hymn, you need to know who wrote it. John Newton was a slave trader. He commanded ships transporting kidnapped Africans across the Atlantic in horrific conditions. When a violent storm nearly sank his ship in 1748, Newton cried out to God. That moment began a long transformation—but even after his conversion, he continued in the slave trade for years. Only later did he become an active abolitionist, working with William Wilberforce to end the slave trade in Britain. When Newton called himself a wretch, he wasn't being dramatic. He was being factual.

Modern Christianity has softened "wretch" in some hymnals: "that saved and strengthened me" or "that saved a soul like me." But the softening misses the point entirely. Grace only makes sense if we're honest about what we're being saved from. If we're basically good people who just need a little help, grace isn't amazing—it's redundant. But if we're wretches—so far gone we can't save ourselves—then grace isn't just nice. It's necessary. It's scandalous. It's amazing.

The word "wretch" isn't about self-loathing. It's about honest assessment. Romans 3:23 says "all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." All. We're all wretches in need of grace. And that's good news. Because if grace is only for the basically good, most of us are disqualified. But if grace is for wretches, we all qualify.

The blog writing captures the journey: "I traded it in for my version of freedom / Ruling others from my own throne." This is the Genesis 3 temptation: "You will be like God"—the belief that we can define reality for ourselves. So I took the gifts and threw them away for my version of freedom. And my version of freedom turned out to be slavery. "The freedom I was living / Turned out to make me a slave / Rather than bringing life to me / It buried me in my own grave."

Sometimes God lets us exhaust our own options. He lets the path we've chosen reveal its true nature. He lets us hit the dead end. Not because He's cruel, but because that's when we're finally ready to listen.

"I stepped off that dead end road / And simply trusted He would save / With each step I took, I felt His hand / Lifting me out of my grave." *Simply trusted.* Not "I cleaned myself up and then approached." Just trust. That's all grace requires. And the miracle: with each step toward the water, I felt His hand. Not after I arrived. *With each step.* He met me in the moving.

"Amazing Grace" has endured for centuries because we're all wretches, and we all need grace. The scandal isn't just that grace saved me once. The scandal is that grace keeps saving me—daily, hourly, every time I turn from the dead-end road and move toward the water's edge.


## Key Takeaways

- **Grace is for wretches, not nice people.** If you deserved it, it wouldn't be grace—it would be payment. The scandal is that God loves you while you're still a mess.
- **You traded true freedom for false freedom.** Autonomy isn't liberty—it's slavery in disguise. Real freedom comes through surrender to the One who died to set you free.
- **Grace is costly, not cheap.** It cost Christ His life and will cost you your old life built on self-rule. But what you gain is life itself.
- **Your dead-end road is grace's invitation.** When your self-made path stops short of living water, step off and run toward it.


## Closing Image

You're standing in the water now. Not all the way in yet—just ankle-deep. But you're in.

And the water is exactly what was promised. Living. Flowing. Clean.

The mud from the swamp is starting to wash away. Not all at once, but gradually. With each step deeper, more of it lifts off and is carried downstream.

You look down at your feet and you can see them clearly for the first time in years. The water is so clear you can see straight to the bottom. And you realize: This is what I've been longing for. Not just to be clean, but to be seen—truly seen—and loved anyway.

*Take a breath.*

You cup water in your hands and pour it over your arms. The mud runs off in brown streams. Underneath: skin. Your actual skin.

You're still a mess. You're still covered in swamp residue. But you're also being washed. Both are true at the same time.

And from somewhere deep inside—deeper than the shame, deeper than the fear, deeper than the old lies—you hear it rising up. Your voice. Singing.

*Amazing grace, how sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me. I once was lost but now I'm found, was blind but now I see.*

It's not just a hymn anymore. It's your story.

You're at the water's edge. You've stepped in. And grace is washing you clean.

One step at a time. One breath at a time. One grace-filled moment at a time.

You're being made new. And it's only just beginning.

# Out of the Swamp: How I Found Truth (Chapter 7)


### MOVEMENT 2: AT THE WATER'S EDGE (The Turning)
### Chapter 7: Dig a Little Deeper

[Dig a Little Deeper](https://www.skylerthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Dig-a-Little-Deeper.mp3)

**An Invitation to Go Deeper**

You've journeyed through six chapters now. You've named the swamp, cried out, died to the old, stepped into living water, found shelter in grace, and received what you don't deserve.

You've been washed. The surface mud is gone. You look better. Smell better. Function better.

But now I need to ask you something uncomfortable:

**Are you willing to let grace go deeper than the surface?**

Because here's what I've learned: Getting clean isn't the same as getting healed.

It's like the sign in the doctor's office: "Do you want to be right, or do you want to be well?"

You can wash off the mud and still carry the wounds underneath. You can look healed on the outside while the infection still festers inside. You can function well while the scar tissue hides the pain you've never actually dealt with.

Grace doesn't just want to clean you up. Grace wants to heal you from the inside out. And that requires digging—opening wounds you've spent years protecting, feeling pain you've been numbing, facing truths you've been avoiding.

**Here's the hard truth nobody tells you upfront: You can't heal what you won't feel. And you can't feel what you keep buried.**

This chapter is about excavation. About going beneath the surface to the deep places where real transformation happens.

And I'm not going to lie to you—it's terrifying. It's going to hurt. You're going to want to stop halfway through and just settle for looking clean on the outside.

But if you're willing—if you can say, even with fear, "God, I don't want to just look healed, I want to BE healed. Dig as deep as You need to"—then what comes next will transform you from the inside out.

**Are you ready to go deeper? To let grace excavate not just your behavior but your heart? To dig through the scar tissue until you hit bedrock truth?**

If yes, take a breath and keep reading.

This is where transformation stops being surface-level and starts becoming soul-level.

## Key Themes

### 1. The Depths of Grace: How Wide, How Long, How High, How Deep

The Apostle Paul prays one of the most beautiful prayers in Scripture in Ephesians 3:

> "May you have the power to understand, as all God's people should, how wide, how long, how high, and how deep his love is. May you experience the love of Christ, though it is too great to understand fully. Then you will be made complete with all the fullness of life and power that comes from God."
>
> — Ephesians 3:18-19 (NLT)

How wide? Wide enough to reach every person. No one is outside the reach of this love.

How long? Long enough to span eternity. This love has no beginning and no end.

How high? High enough to lift us from the lowest pit to the highest heights.

How deep? Deep enough to reach the deepest wound, the darkest shame, the most hidden brokenness.

Grace doesn't skim the surface. It goes all the way down. Down to the root. Down to the original pain. Down to the place you've been protecting because you're terrified that if anyone sees it, you'll be rejected.

But grace isn't afraid of your depth.

Grace dives. Grace excavates. Grace says: "Show me the wound. I know how to heal it."

Philip Yancey writes:

> "Grace, like water, flows to the lowest part."
>
> — Philip Yancey, *The Jesus I Never Knew*

Grace doesn't wait at the surface for us to climb up. It descends—all the way down to the lowest, darkest, most wounded places.

That's where grace does its deepest work.

### 2. Spiritual Formation as Excavation, Not Construction

We tend to think of spiritual growth as building something. Adding disciplines. Improving behavior. Constructing a better version of ourselves.

But that's not how it works.

Spiritual formation is more like archaeology than architecture. Excavation, not construction.

You're not building a new self from scratch. You're uncovering your true self—the image of the Divine that's been buried under layers of wounds, lies, and false beliefs.

Dallas Willard writes:

> "Actions are not impositions on who we are, but are expressions of who we are. They come out of our heart and the inner realities it supervises and interacts with."
>
> — Dallas Willard, *Renovation of the Heart*

Who you are at the core—created in love's image, beloved, chosen, redeemed—is already true. But it's buried.

Digging deeper means removing what doesn't belong so the truth can emerge.

Think of a sculptor chipping away marble to reveal the statue that's been there all along. The sculptor doesn't create the statue from nothing. The work is removing everything that isn't the statue.

That's what digging deeper does. It removes the false beliefs, the protective layers, the scar tissue—not to create something new, but to reveal what's always been true underneath.

Thomas Merton understood this:

> "There is only one problem on which all my existence, my peace, and my happiness depend: to discover myself in discovering God. If I find Him I will find myself and if I find my true self I will find Him."
>
> — Thomas Merton, *The Seven Storey Mountain*

### 3. Digging Through the Layers

The journey inward follows a pattern:

**Layer 1: Performance**

On the surface, we perform. We present the version of ourselves we think will be acceptable. We wear masks. Manage impressions. Work hard to look good, sound good, appear to have it together.

This is exhausting. Performance is never finished.

**Layer 2: Shame**

Underneath performance is shame. The voice that says: "If they really knew me, they'd reject me. If they saw the real me—messy, broken, failing—they'd turn away."

Shame is what drives performance. We perform because we're ashamed of what we think people will see if we stop.

**Layer 3: Wounds**

Underneath shame are the wounds. The things that happened to us. The ways we were hurt, betrayed, abandoned, abused. The traumas, large and small, that marked us.

Wounds aren't our fault. They're what was done to us. But they shape us. They create patterns of response that become automatic.

**Layer 4: False Beliefs**

Underneath the wounds are the false beliefs. The conclusions we drew from the wounds about ourselves, about others, about reality.

"I'm not good enough."
"Every statement is a criticism."
"Responses are always taken the wrong way."
"I have to be intense or I won't be taken seriously."
"If I'm not perfect, I'll be abandoned."

These beliefs formed in moments of pain. And they've been running our lives ever since.

**Layer 5: Bedrock Truth**

All the way down, beneath all the layers, is the bedrock truth:

You are loved. You are worthy. You are enough. You are beloved.

This truth was true before the wounds. It remained true through the wounds. And it's true now, underneath all the layers.

Digging deeper means excavating through performance, shame, wounds, and false beliefs until you hit bedrock.

### 4. Finding Treasure Buried in the Depths

Jesus tells a parable in Matthew 13:

> "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure that a man discovered hidden in a field. In his excitement, he hid it again and sold everything he owned to get enough money to buy the field."
>
> — Matthew 13:44 (NLT)

The treasure is there. Already in the field. The work isn't creating the treasure—it's finding it.

Once you find it, you'll give up everything to possess it. Not out of obligation. Out of joy.

That's what digging deeper does. It helps you find the treasure that's been there all along—your true self, your real identity, the image of love in you.

The performance? Exhausting. Let it go.
The shame? A lie. Let it go.
The false beliefs? Not bedrock. Let them go.

What remains is who you've always been, underneath: Beloved.

### 5. Surface Religion vs. Deep Transformation

Jesus had no patience for surface religion. He called out the religious leaders repeatedly:

> "What sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you Pharisees. Hypocrites! For you are so careful to clean the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside you are filthy—full of greed and self-indulgence! You blind Pharisee! First wash the inside of the cup and the dish, and then the outside will become clean, too."
>
> — Matthew 23:25-26 (NLT)

Surface religion focuses on the outside: behavior, appearance, performance.

Deep transformation focuses on the inside: the heart, the motives, the beliefs that drive behavior.

You can clean up your behavior without touching your heart. You can look like a "good person" on the outside while still being driven by shame, fear, and false beliefs inside.

Paul captures this in 2 Corinthians 3:18:

> "So all of us who have had that veil removed can see and reflect the glory of the Lord. And the Lord—who is the Spirit—makes us more and more like him as we are changed into his glorious image."
>
> — 2 Corinthians 3:18 (NLT)

Transformation. Not behavior modification. Not surface cleaning. Transformation from the inside out.

And it comes not from our striving but from beholding. From contemplating Love's glory with unveiled faces—no masks, no performance.

A.W. Tozer writes:

> "What comes into our minds when we think about God is the most important thing about us."
>
> — A.W. Tozer, *The Knowledge of the Holy*

When we behold rightly, we cannot remain unchanged.

## The Core Scripture Truth

Here's the promise that makes digging possible:

> "If you look for me wholeheartedly, you will find me."
>
> — Jeremiah 29:13 (NLT)

God isn't hiding from you. He's not playing games.

But He is deep. And finding Him requires going deep.

"With all your heart." Not with half. Not with the surface layer. With all of it. The whole thing. The wounds and the shame and the false beliefs and the raw, unfiltered need.

When you seek Him there—in the depths, not just the shallows—you find Him. And when you find Him, you discover He's been there all along. In the deep. Waiting for you to stop protecting yourself long enough to let Him in.

## Song Integration

"Time heals all wounds"—it sounds like truth until you discover something painful: time doesn't heal wounds. Time just buries them deeper under layers of scar tissue until we've convinced ourselves we're fine when we're actually just numb.

"Dig a Little Deeper" emerged from that season of excavation—when I learned you can't heal what you won't feel, and you can't feel what you keep buried.

My counselor, Dr. Petit, explained it with devastating clarity: "It's been said time heals all wounds...yet for the untreated or poorly treated wound, time will infect then scar. For the unset or improperly set bone, time will knit then lame." This is medically accurate. A wound left untreated doesn't heal—it becomes infected and forms scar tissue over the infection. A broken bone left unset knits back together in the wrong position, leaving you permanently lame.

The same is true spiritually and emotionally. Time doesn't heal soul wounds. Proper treatment does. And proper treatment requires digging—opening the wound, draining the infection, then giving time as the servant of healing rather than as the supposed healer itself. For years, I'd been functioning around my wounds rather than healing them. I looked healed. I sounded healed. But I was just well-rehearsed at hiding.

The turning point came when my counselor helped me distinguish between the "reactive self" and the "real self." After moments when I'd reacted poorly, he would ask: "What specifically was reactive? Once that becomes clear, we can explore why that's a trigger." That question opened the door to excavation. Triggers aren't random. They're connected to wounds. To disarm the trigger, you have to heal the wound. But to heal the wound, you have to open it.

The song begins by calling out the platitude: "They say that time can heal what's broke, but it just whispers empty hope." The pre-chorus captures the breaking point: "I tried to fake it 'til I made it, but I can't outrun what's breaking me." The decision to stop running and start digging.

The chorus is theologically crucial: "So I'm gonna dig a little deeper, down where the hurting hides. Open the scar so grace can reach, the pain that's buried deep inside." We don't dig just to feel the pain—we dig so grace can reach what's been inaccessible. As long as the wound is buried under scar tissue, grace can't touch it. But when we expose it to light and truth, grace can do its healing work. "It's gonna hurt, I know it will, and healing starts when I finally feel."

Verse two introduces the promise: "Truth won't run, it stands its ground, and mercy whispers through the sound: 'You're not alone, I'm still right here, even in your tears.'" Presence in the pain. God doesn't wait until we're healed to show up. He meets us in the mess, in the tears, in the raw exposed wound.

The bridge confesses dependence: "I can't do this on my own, but I was never meant to be alone." We need divine help and human help. "You reach into the mess I've made, and call my broken heart by name." God doesn't wait for us to clean up before reaching in.

The final chorus testifies: "So I dig a little deeper, You meet me in the pain. You wash my wounds with holy light, and I am whole again. It hurts, but I can feel again." The paradox of healing: the pain doesn't disappear, but it's no longer the only reality.

Since writing this song, excavation has become a rhythm, not a one-time event. But I'm no longer afraid of the digging. The deeper I go, the more grace I find. Time doesn't heal all wounds. But grace—when we're willing to dig deep enough to let it reach us—heals what time cannot.


**Verse 2**
The night comes calling like before,
I see those shadows on my door.
Every memory wakes again,
I feel the weight I can't defend.

Truth won't run, it stands its ground,
And mercy whispers through the sound:
"You're not alone, I'm still right here,
Even in your tears."

**Pre-Chorus**
I've tried to numb it, tried to drown it,
But grace keeps reaching down for me.

**Chorus**
So I'm gonna dig a little deeper,
Down where the hurting hides.
Open the scar so grace can reach,
The pain that's buried deep inside.
It's gonna hurt, I know it will,
And healing starts when I finally feel.
I'm gonna dig, dig a little deeper,
'Til I find my soul.


**Bridge**
I can't do this on my own,
But I was never meant to be alone.
You reach into the mess I've made,
And call my broken heart by name.
You say, "Come and drink from the well that won't run dry."
And for the first time, I believe — I'm alive.

## Key Takeaways

- **Time doesn't heal wounds—proper treatment does.** Scars can fool you into thinking you're healed when you're just covered up. Real healing requires excavation, not just waiting.
- **You can't heal what you won't feel.** To heal deep wounds, you must cut through scar tissue, open the pain, drain the infection, and let grace reach what's been buried.
- **Transformation is excavation, not construction.** You're not building a new self—you're uncovering your true self by removing layers of wounds, shame, and false beliefs until you hit bedrock truth.
- **The deepest truth is your belovedness.** Beneath all the layers—performance, shame, wounds, lies—is the unchanging reality: you are loved, worthy, and enough because God says so.

## Closing Image

You're in the water now, and it's deeper than before. Not ankle-deep anymore. Waist-deep. The current is stronger here, pulling at you, but also holding you.

And you're doing something you've never done before: you're digging. Not on dry land where you can control the excavation. In the water. Letting the current carry away what you unearth.

You dig through performance—the mask you've worn for so long it feels like your face. You lift it off and hand it to the current. It floats away downstream.

You dig through shame—the voice that's been screaming "you're not enough" for years. You name it as a lie, and the water washes it away.

You dig through the wounds—the places where you were hurt, betrayed, abandoned. You open them to the light and air, and you feel the sting. But you also feel the water, clean and living, flowing into the wound. Washing out the infection. Beginning to heal what's been festering in the dark.

You dig through the false beliefs—"I'm broken beyond repair," "I'm too much," "I'm not enough"—and as each one surfaces, you hold it up to the light. And in the light, you see it for what it is: a lie. Not bedrock. Not truth. Just debris.

And finally—finally—you hit bedrock.

Solid. Unshakeable. True.

*Take a breath.*

You are loved. You are worthy. You are enough. You are beloved. Not because of what you do. Because of who you are. Who you've always been, underneath.

The water is deeper here. But you're not drowning. You're standing. On bedrock. And the current that once felt threatening now feels like an embrace.

You've dug a little deeper. And what you found—what was there all along—is grace. Deep, abiding, bedrock grace.

Great is His faithfulness. New every morning. Deep enough to reach the deepest wound. Strong enough to carry you through the healing.

You're not done digging. There's always more to uncover. Always deeper to go.

But you're not afraid anymore. Because you know now: the deeper you dig, the more grace you find.

And grace, you're discovering, has no bottom.

# Out of the Swamp: How I Found Truth (Movement 3)


### MOVEMENT 3: UNFORCED RHYTHMS OF LIFE (The Transformation)

> "Are you tired? Worn out? Burned out on religion? Come to me. Get away with me and you'll recover your life. I'll show you how to take a real rest. Walk with me and work with me—watch how I do it. Learn the unforced rhythms of grace. I won't lay anything heavy or ill-fitting on you. Keep company with me and you'll learn to live freely and lightly."
>
> — Matthew 11:28-30 (The Message)


Here's the hard truth: Most of us have been in survival mode so long, we've forgotten there's another way to live.

Survival is getting through. Transformation is growing into.

In the swamp, survival was the only option. You were drowning—just trying to breathe, trying to make it one more day.

At the water's edge, you moved from drowning to breathing. From desperation to hope. From death to life.

But this? This is different.

This is learning to live beyond crisis. To build a life that doesn't just react to emergencies but actually grows toward something. To develop rhythms that sustain you not just in the hard seasons, but in every season.

This is where transformation happens. Not in the dramatic moment of crisis or the pivotal encounter at the shoreline, but in the steady, daily rhythm of learning to walk with God.

You've left the swamp. You've been washed at the water's edge. Now you're learning what it means to live—really live—in the unforced rhythms of grace.


These chapters don't offer a program to complete. They offer a way to walk. A rhythm to learn. A life to live.

Not perfectly. Not without stumbling. But with a new kind of stability. Because the roots are going deep. The rhythms are becoming established.

The swamp taught you honesty. The water's edge taught you grace. Now the rhythm teaches you sustainability.

This is where faith becomes a way of life instead of a series of desperate rescues. Where spiritual life stops being exhausting and starts being life-giving. Where you discover that grace isn't just the emergency intervention—it's the daily bread. The morning-by-morning manna.

You've made it through the swamp. You've stepped into the water. Now you're discovering what it means to let grace carry you—to live in the rhythms you were designed for all along.

Welcome to the unforced rhythms of grace.

This is where transformation happens.

# Out of the Swamp: How I Found Truth (Chapter 8)


### MOVEMENT 3: UNFORCED RHYTHMS OF LIFE (The Transformation)
### Chapter 8: Unforced Rhythms of Grace

[Mindful Bliss of Grace](https://www.skylerthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Mindful-Bliss-Female.mp3)

**Listen at:** http://go.skylerthomas.com/jYgQNf

![Scan to listen: Mindful Bliss of Grace](qr-ch09-mindful-bliss.png)


**An Invitation to Rest**

You've walked through seven chapters now. You've named the swamp, cried out for help, let something die, stepped into living water, found shelter in grace's shadow, received what you don't deserve, and dug deep to let healing reach the wounds.

You've experienced dramatic grace. Life-changing encounters. Rescue. Cleansing. Healing.

But now I need to ask you something important:

**Are you exhausted from trying to maintain the intensity?**

Because here's what happens after the crisis: We try to keep the fire burning through sheer effort and willpower. We pray longer. Read more. Volunteer for everything. We assume that sustaining grace requires the same intensity as receiving it.

And we almost crash again. Different swamp, same drowning.

Here's what I've discovered: **Grace isn't meant to be lived in constant crisis mode.**

The swamp taught you honesty. The water's edge taught you grace. But now? Now you're learning something that might feel revolutionary—or maybe even scandalous:

**You don't have to keep performing. You can rest. Even while you're working.**

This chapter is about the shift from frenzy to rhythm. From desperate intervention to daily bread. From crisis faith to sustainable presence.

It's about discovering that grace offers rhythm—a sustainable way of walking with God that actually fits with how you're made. Not manufactured intensity. Not constant peak experiences. Not exhausting striving.

*Unforced rhythms.*

But here's the challenge: If you've been living in frenzy for years—and most of us have—rhythm will feel foreign at first. Maybe even wrong. The guilt will whisper, "Shouldn't I be doing more?" The fear will ask, "What if I fall behind?" The comparison will accuse, "Everyone else seems busier. Am I being lazy?"

So before you continue, pause. Consider:

*Can you say, even tentatively: "God, I'm tired of running. I'm willing to learn a different pace. I'm willing to believe that You delight in me when I'm resting as much as when I'm working. Teach me Your unforced rhythms."*

That's enough. That willingness opens the door.

Welcome to the unforced rhythms of grace.

## Key Themes

### 1. From Hype to Home: The Set Point Theory

There's a concept in psychology called the "set point" theory—a baseline level of well-being that's relatively stable over time. Good things happen, bad things happen, but we tend to return to our set point.

Here's why this matters for understanding grace: Grace doesn't promise constant emotional highs.

Grace offers something better: a stable foundation beneath the fluctuations.

Not hype, but home.
Not peak experiences, but sustainable presence.
Not manufactured intensity, but authentic rhythm.

You can have a hard day and still be grounded in grace. You can feel sad and still be held by God. You can experience disappointment, frustration, even anger—and still be living in the unforced rhythms of grace.

Because grace isn't about eliminating life's natural ups and downs. It's about providing the steady baseline—the set point—from which you experience them.

I spent years chasing the high. The worship experience that gave me goosebumps. The prayer time where I felt God's presence palpably. The Bible study where everything clicked.

And then I'd crash. The goosebumps would fade. The presence would feel distant. The clarity would blur. And I'd think, "I'm losing it. I'm backsliding. I need to try harder."

So I'd manufacture the intensity. Force the experience. Push for the feeling.

And I'd burn out. Again and again.

Until I discovered: Grace isn't the high. Grace is the home. The stable foundation. The set point.

Some days are up. Some days are down. But underneath it all, there's grace. Steady. Reliable. New every morning.

Henri Nouwen captures this:

> "The greatest gift of the spiritual life is to be able to rest in God's presence."
> — Henri Nouwen, *The Return of the Prodigal Son*

Not to perform in God's presence. Not to achieve in God's presence. To rest.

### 2. Daily Bread, Daily Grace: The Manna Experience

When Israel wandered in the wilderness, God provided manna—bread from heaven—every single morning. But there were rules: gather only what you need for today. Don't try to hoard it for tomorrow. Trust that tomorrow will have its own provision.

Living in unforced rhythms means participating in a manna experience:
- You don't have to figure out next month's provision today
- You just gather today's manna
- You trust tomorrow will have its own
- You don't hoard grace; you receive it fresh each morning

This is what Jesus taught His disciples to pray: "Give us this day our daily bread." Not weekly bread. Not monthly bread. Daily bread.

I'm a planner. I want to have the next three months figured out. I want backup plans for my backup plans. I want to secure tomorrow's grace today, just in case God doesn't show up tomorrow.

But that's not how manna works. That's not how grace works.

When Israel tried to hoard manna, it rotted. It bred worms. It stank.

When I try to hoard grace—when I try to manufacture tomorrow's provision today—it does the same thing. It becomes dead religion instead of living relationship. Performance instead of presence. Anxiety instead of trust.

The manna experience teaches me: Today's grace is sufficient for today. And tomorrow's grace will come tomorrow.

This is freedom. The freedom to be fully present to today instead of anxiously trying to control tomorrow.

### 3. From Survival to Thriving: Asking Different Questions

In the swamp, survival was the only option. How do I make it through today? How do I keep breathing?

At the water's edge, you moved from crisis to cleansing. Still focused on immediate needs.

But in the unforced rhythms of grace, you're learning to thrive. You're not just reacting to crises anymore. You're building a sustainable life. You're asking different questions:

- What do I want to see MORE of in my life?
- What do I want to see LESS of?
- What do I want NOT AT ALL anymore?

MORE: Connection with God. Authentic community. Creative expression. Rest. Joy. Presence.

LESS: Hurry. Performance. People-pleasing. Comparison. Distraction.

NOT AT ALL: Shame. Fear-based motivation. Relationships that drain rather than energize.

These aren't rules. They're rhythms. Patterns you choose because they bring life.

And here's the beautiful thing: When you live from these rhythms long enough, they stop feeling like discipline and start feeling like desire. You don't have to force yourself to rest—you crave it.

This is the shift from duty to delight. From obligation to overflow. From working toward rest to working from rest.

**Becoming Real Takes Time**

Margery Williams captures this in *The Velveteen Rabbit*:

> "It doesn't happen all at once. You become. It takes a long time... Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand."
> — Margery Williams, *The Velveteen Rabbit*

Becoming Real—learning to live in unforced rhythms—means being loved into authenticity over time. Your rough edges get worn smooth through the daily friction of grace. You get "loose in the joints"—less rigid, more flexible, more able to bend without breaking. You become "shabby" by the world's standards—less polished, less impressive. But you're Real. Authentic. No longer performing.

This is what the unforced rhythms are creating in you. Not overnight transformation. But steady, gentle, persistent becoming.

You're being loved into who you actually are. And that takes time. Be patient with yourself.

### 4. Jesus' Rhythm: The Model for Sustainability

If you want to understand unforced rhythms, watch Jesus. He's the master of sustainable spiritual life. He never burned out. Never collapsed under the weight of ministry. Never lost His connection to the Father.

How?

Rhythm.

Mark 1:35 captures it perfectly:

> "Before daybreak the next morning, Jesus got up and went out to an isolated place to pray."
> — Mark 1:35 (NLT)

This wasn't a one-time event. It was His pattern. His rhythm. Withdrawal and engagement. Solitude and community. Prayer and action. Rest and work.

Jesus would pour Himself out in ministry—teaching, healing, casting out demons. Then He would withdraw. To a solitary place. To pray. To reconnect with the Father. To be refilled.

He didn't wait until He was empty. He maintained the rhythm.

Engagement. Withdrawal. Engagement. Withdrawal.

Because He lived in this rhythm, He had something to give. Not out of duty. Out of overflow.

And notice: Jesus faced immense pressure to skip the rhythm. People were sick. Crowds were waiting. There was always more to do.

But He protected the rhythm. He withdrew even when others wanted more from Him. He rested even when the need was urgent.

Why? Because He knew: If I don't maintain the rhythm, I'll have nothing to give.

I've spent most of my Christian life trying to give from empty. Leading worship when I was spiritually depleted. Teaching when I hadn't spent time with God myself. Serving when I desperately needed rest.

And I wondered why I burned out.

Jesus shows a different way. Maintain the rhythm. Not after you've earned it. Not when the work is done. As part of the work.

## The Core Scripture Truth

**Matthew 11:28-30** - "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light."

This is Jesus' manifesto for sustainable spiritual life.

**"Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened"**

Jesus' invitation is not to the strong. It's to the exhausted. The burned out. The ones carrying loads they were never meant to carry.

If you're tired—not just physically tired, but soul-tired—you're exactly who Jesus is calling.

**"I will give you rest"**

Not "I will give you more work." Rest. Soul rest. The kind that comes not from escaping responsibility but from living in rhythm with grace.

**"Take my yoke upon you"**

Jesus isn't calling you to quit everything. He's calling you to work—but to work in partnership with Him. To let Him set the pace. To let Him carry the weight.

**"Learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart"**

Jesus doesn't drive you with shame. Doesn't demand perfection. He is gentle. Humble. Patient. And as you learn from Him—as you watch His rhythms, adopt His patterns, live in His pace—you discover a different way of being.

**"You will find rest for your souls"**

Not just physical rest. Soul rest. The deep, abiding peace that comes from living in alignment with how you were made.

**"My yoke is easy and my burden is light"**

Easy doesn't mean effortless. It means well-fitting. Like a yoke custom-made for the ox wearing it. Jesus' way of life fits you.

Light doesn't mean weightless. It means right-sized. Not crushing. Bearable. More than bearable—life-giving.

## Song Integration

I was drowning in activity when I discovered that Jesus' yoke is actually easy. For years, I'd been living at breakneck speed—calendar packed, to-do list never-ending, mind constantly racing. I wore busyness like a badge of honor, convinced that exhaustion proved devotion. But I was running on fumes, burned out. Then I crashed. Not dramatically—just stopped.

In that crashed season, my counselor asked me a question I couldn't answer: "When was the last time you noticed God's presence without trying to do anything with it?" I sat there, silent. Because every spiritual practice had become performance. Every quiet time had an agenda. I'd turned even rest into productivity. He gave me one assignment: "Go for a walk. Don't pray. Don't problem-solve. Don't plan. Just notice." And then: "Read Matthew 11:28-30. Not to study it. Just to hear it."

Eugene Peterson's translation in The Message unlocked everything: *"Are you tired? Worn out? Burned out on religion? Come to me. Get away with me and you'll recover your life. I'll show you how to take a real rest. Walk with me and work with me—watch how I do it. Learn the unforced rhythms of grace. I won't lay anything heavy or ill-fitting on you. Keep company with me and you'll learn to live freely and lightly."*

**Unforced rhythms.** That phrase stopped me. Because everything in my life felt forced—forced discipline, forced devotion, forced productivity. I was carrying a yoke, but it wasn't easy and light. It was heavy and crushing. And Jesus was saying: That's not My yoke. Mine has rhythm. And the rhythm is unforced.

So I went for the walk. One of the first times I'd walked without an agenda in years. No podcast. No problem to solve. Just walking. Noticing. The sun coming up. Air cool. Dew on the grass catching the light. Birds singing. My own breathing—in and out, steady, unforced. And I felt something I hadn't felt in years: peace. Not the absence of problems, but a deep-down settledness that said, "This moment is enough."

This was what Jesus meant. This unforced presence. This gentle noticing. This rhythm that doesn't demand but invites. Not the frenzy of "I have to do more" but the rhythm of "I'm already held." Not the grinding of "I must prove my worth" but the breathing of "I'm already loved."

The song had to *sound* unforced. So the tempo is slow, gentle—like a walk, not a run. Like inhaling and exhaling, not gasping. The melody flows without sharp edges. The instrumentation is sparse—space between the notes, room to breathe. The opposite of the packed-calendar, no-margin life I'd been living.

The verses move through different times of day—sunset, morning, starry night—each one an invitation to notice, to be present. But then the chorus shifts: *"Great is Your faithfulness, steady and true, mercies each morning are always brand new."* This anchors everything in Lamentations 3:22-23. Life still has ebb and flow, but underneath it all, there's grace—steady, reliable, new every morning.

The bridge acknowledges reality: "Life feels like ebb and flow, highs and lows take their toll." Because the chaos does return. But now I have a different response: "But in Your presence I find my rest, held in the stillness You manifest." Rest isn't the absence of activity. Rest is presence—being held in God's stillness even when life isn't still.

When I slip back into frenzy, I sing this. And it brings me back—back to breath, back to rhythm, back to the truth that Jesus' yoke is easy and His burden is light.

## Key Takeaways

- **Grace offers rhythm, not frenzy.** You don't have to maintain crisis-level intensity to stay faithful. Jesus' yoke is easy and light because it fits how you're designed to live.
- **Receive daily bread, don't hoard tomorrow's grace.** Like manna in the wilderness, grace is meant to be gathered fresh each morning. Trust today's provision and let tomorrow take care of itself.
- **Work from rest, not toward it.** Sustainable faithfulness means maintaining rhythm—withdrawal and engagement, solitude and community, Sabbath and work—just as Jesus modeled.
- **Your worth isn't measured by productivity.** Resting is an act of faith, declaring that God values you as His beloved child whether you're producing or simply being present.

## Closing Image

You're not at the water's edge anymore. You've waded in deeper. And you've discovered something surprising: the water has a current.

Not a violent current that sweeps you away. A gentle current. A flow. And when you stop fighting it—when you stop trying to control every movement—you realize the current is carrying you.

This is what the unforced rhythms feel like. You're not striving anymore. Not forcing. Not manufacturing spiritual experiences or trying to prove your worth through exhausting effort.

You're flowing. With grace. In rhythm.

Some days the water is calm. You float. You rest. You simply be.

Some days the water is active. You swim. You work. You engage. But even the swimming feels different now. You're not swimming against the current. You're swimming with it, letting it carry you along.

You look up and see the sun filtering through the water. Streaks of light. Steady. Reliable. New every morning.

Great is His faithfulness.

You take a breath—deep, full, unforced. And you realize: this is sustainable. This is how you were meant to live. Not in crisis mode. Not in frenzy. But in rhythm. In flow. In the unforced rhythms of grace.

Into mindful bliss.

# Out of the Swamp: How I Found Truth (Chapter 9)


### MOVEMENT 3: UNFORCED RHYTHMS OF LIFE (The Transformation)
### Chapter 9: Deep Roots, Strong Growth

[I Will Trust You Lord](https://www.skylerthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/I-Will-Trust-You-Lord.mp3)

**Listen at:** http://go.skylerthomas.com/DxCmnx

![Scan to listen: I Will Trust You Lord](qr-ch10-trust-you-lord.png)


**An Invitation to Go Deeper**

You've discovered rhythm. You've learned the unforced way of living. You're not in crisis mode anymore.

But now I need to ask you something uncomfortable:

**When stress comes, when pressure mounts, when circumstances get hard—do you still revert to old patterns?**

Be honest. Do you still react defensively when criticized? Still withdraw when hurt? Still carry bitterness longer than you should?

Here's what I've discovered: **Rhythms are good. But rhythms without roots become rote. Practices without depth become performance.**

You need more than sustainable patterns. You need deep foundations. The kind that reach down to streams of living water and anchor you when everything else shakes.

This chapter is about what happens underground. The hidden work. The slow transformation that no one sees but everyone eventually experiences.

It's about discovering that you're not just learning new habits—you're becoming a new person. And becoming takes time. It happens in the dark, unseen, in the patient work of roots going deep.

*Think of a tree during drought. Surface plants die—they had no depth, no reserves, nothing to draw from when conditions got hard. But the deeply rooted? They stay green. Not because they're stronger or trying harder. Because their roots have gone deep enough to reach water others can't access.*

That's what this chapter is about. Not what you look like on the surface. But what's happening underground.

Deep roots require putting to death what doesn't belong: pride, reactivity, isolation, bitterness. And cultivating what does: humility, responsiveness, connection, forgiveness.

None of this is impressive. None of this gets applause.

But it's everything. Because roots determine what happens above ground.

So before you continue, pause. Consider:

*Can you say, even with hesitation: "God, I don't just want to look different. I want to BE different. Do the deep work in me—the underground work, the unseen work. Send my roots down deep until I'm anchored in You."*

That's the prayer that opens transformation.

## Key Themes

### 1. The Work of Putting to Death

Before roots can go deep into what belongs, they have to let go of what doesn't.

There are things that have to be put to death:

**Pride** - The need to be right. The compulsion to prove ourselves. The addiction to being seen, recognized, validated by others.

Pride keeps roots shallow because it keeps us focused on ourselves rather than God. We're constantly comparing, competing, defending, performing. All that energy goes into image management rather than transformation.

I've spent years defending myself. Explaining myself. Making sure people understood my motives. And all that defending kept me shallow. Because I was more concerned with how I looked than with who I was becoming.

Humility is the antidote. Not self-hatred. But the freedom to be wrong and still be loved. To lose the argument and not lose yourself.

**Reactivity** - Responding from wounds instead of from identity. When someone criticizes you, do you react defensively? When life doesn't go your way, do you lash out?

Reactivity is living from your False Self—the wounded, defended, self-protective version of you.

Deep roots grow when you learn to respond from your True Self—the beloved, secure, grounded-in-God version of you.

There's a space between what happens to us and how we respond. In that space lies our power to choose.

I've been working on this for years, and I still fail regularly. Someone questions my decision, and I immediately get defensive. Someone misunderstands my motives, and I rush to explain. Someone hurts me, and I want to hurt back.

But I'm learning. Learning to pause. To feel the reaction without acting on it. To ask: "Is this coming from my woundedness or from my belovedness?"

That pause—that space between stimulus and response—is where deep roots grow.

**Isolation** - The temptation to withdraw when things get hard. To hide your struggles. To pretend you're fine when you're not.

Isolation is the enemy of deep roots. Trees don't grow in isolation—they grow in groves, forests, communities where their roots intertwine with other roots, creating stability and sharing nutrients.

I'm an introvert. When I'm hurting, my instinct is to withdraw. To pull back. To process alone. And sometimes that's healthy. But isolation as a lifestyle? That's deadly.

Deep roots require staying connected even when you want to withdraw. Showing up to community even when you don't feel like it. Being honest about your struggles even when it's scary.

**Bitterness** - The nursing of perceived injustices. The rehearsal of how you've been wronged. The refusal to forgive.

Bitterness is like poison in the soil. It doesn't hurt the person you're bitter toward—it hurts you. It keeps your roots shallow and twisted.

I've carried bitterness. Rehearsed conversations with people who hurt me. Kept score. Built cases. And all that bitterness did was keep me stuck.

Forgiveness is the answer. Not because what happened was okay. But because holding onto it gives it power over you.

You release it so your roots can grow deep into grace rather than staying tangled in grievance.

> "To forgive is to set a prisoner free and discover that the prisoner was you."
> — Lewis B. Smedes, *Forgive and Forget*

### 2. The Work of Cultivating What Belongs

Putting to death is only half the work. The other half is cultivating what belongs—the virtues, practices, and postures that create conditions for deep roots.

**Humility** - Acknowledging your need for grace. Admitting you don't have it all together. Embracing your limits rather than pretending they don't exist.

Humility positions you to receive. Pride keeps you on the surface, performing. Humility sends roots deep, receiving.

**Responsiveness** - Acting from your True Self, not your wounded self. Learning to pause between stimulus and response.

This requires self-awareness—knowing your triggers, understanding your patterns, recognizing when you're operating from wounds versus operating from belovedness.

**Connection** - Staying engaged even when vulnerable. Showing up even when it's hard. Choosing relationship over isolation.

I've learned this the hard way: I need people. Not perfect people. Not people who never disappoint me. But people who show up. Who pray for me. Who tell me the truth in love.

Connection is where roots deepen.

**Forgiveness** - Releasing what you can't control. Letting go of the need for justice, vindication, or revenge.

Forgiveness isn't a one-time decision. It's a daily practice. Sometimes an hourly practice. You choose to release the offense again and again until one day you realize it no longer has power over you.

### 3. The Tree by Streams of Water

Psalm 1 paints a picture of flourishing:

> "Blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wicked... but whose delight is in the law of the LORD, and who meditates on his law day and night. That person is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither—whatever they do prospers."
> — Psalm 1:1-3

Notice the progression:

**Planted, not drifting.** Intentional, rooted, stable. You've been planted by streams—the water's edge of grace. Now roots are growing deep.

**Streams of water.** The tree doesn't generate its own water. It's positioned by an abundant source. You don't generate your own grace. You're rooted in God's inexhaustible provision.

**Fruit in season.** Not all the time. Not constantly. In season. This is realistic spirituality. There are seasons of growth, seasons of fruit, seasons of dormancy, seasons of pruning.

**Leaf does not wither.** Even in drought—when emotions are dry, when external supports fail—the deeply rooted tree endures. Why? Because deep roots access water others can't reach.

**Whatever they do prospers.** Not prosperity gospel. This is organic flourishing. A well-rooted tree naturally prospers because it's connected to its source.

### 4. Roots Take Time

Here's what nobody tells you about deep roots: they take time. Years. Sometimes decades.

We want microwavable transformation. But roots don't work that way.

A tree doesn't shoot roots thirty feet down in a week. It takes seasons. Storm after storm. Drought after drought. Year after year, the roots slowly, steadily go deeper.

And for most of that time, you can't see the growth. Above ground, the tree might look unchanged. But below ground, everything is happening.

This is the hidden work of transformation.

I'm fifteen years into this journey. And I'm still discovering shallow roots. Still finding places where I react instead of respond. Still uncovering bitterness I thought I'd released. Still learning to stay connected when I want to withdraw.

But I'm also seeing growth I couldn't see five years ago. Situations that would have wrecked me ten years ago now just... don't. Not because I'm stronger. Because the roots have gone deeper. I'm accessing streams I couldn't reach before.

This is the long obedience in the same direction. This is the slow work of becoming.

> "A Christian is never in a state of completion but always in the process of becoming."
> — Martin Luther, *Lectures on Romans*

## The Core Scripture Truth

**John 15:5** - "I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing."

This is Jesus's teaching on remaining—on abiding.

**"I am the vine; you are the branches."**

The relationship is organic, not mechanical. Living connection. Shared life. The sap that flows through the vine flows through the branches.

You're not disconnected from Jesus, trying to imitate Him from a distance. You're connected to Jesus, sharing His life.

**"If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit."**

The condition is remaining. Not striving. Not performing. Remaining. Abiding. Staying connected.

And the promise is fruit. Not because you're trying to produce it. But because life is flowing from the vine into the branches.

**"Apart from me you can do nothing."**

This is both humbling and liberating. Humbling because it reminds you: you're not the source. You can't generate spiritual life through your own effort.

Liberating because it takes the pressure off. You don't have to produce. You just have to remain.

Deep roots make abiding possible. And abiding makes fruit inevitable.

## Song Integration

The counselor looked at me and said, "You're doing all the right things, but your roots haven't gone deep enough yet."

I didn't want to hear that. I'd been practicing the rhythms for months. Showing up to prayer even when I didn't feel like it. Reading Scripture even when it felt dry. Staying connected to community even when I wanted to withdraw.

But I couldn't see results. I still struggled with the same issues. Still reacted defensively. Still battled pride. Still felt the pull of isolation.

I was discouraged, wondering: *Is any of this working? Am I actually growing? Or am I just going through the motions?*

The answer, I discovered, was that transformation happens underground before it's visible above the surface.

Then I read Psalm 1. And Jeremiah 17. And something clicked.

The tree planted by streams of water doesn't produce fruit immediately. First, roots go down. Deep. Searching for water. Anchoring in soil. Building the underground foundation that will support everything above ground.

The fruit comes later. In season. When roots are ready.

I was expecting visible growth—immediate fruit, dramatic change, measurable progress. But God was doing underground work. Sending my roots deeper. Teaching me to draw from living water instead of surface emotions.

Psalm 1 became my anchor. The tree thrives not because it tries harder but because it's connected to a source of life that never runs dry.

That's when "I Will Trust You Lord" was born. The song is a declaration: even when I can't see growth, even when the work feels invisible, even when drought comes—my roots are going deep. I'm planted by streams of living water. And I will trust the hidden work.

The chorus captures the promise: "Like a tree beside the river, I will stand so tall. Through the fire, through the season, You're my all in all."

Not standing because I'm strong. Standing because I'm rooted. Not thriving because conditions are perfect. Thriving because I'm drawing from a source deeper than circumstances.

The bridge confronts the fears: "No fear in the drought... No doubt in the storm... Your love is my anchor... I'll trust You, Lord."

This isn't denial. It's confidence. Rooted confidence that says: I can face drought because my roots go deeper than surface water. I can weather storms because I'm anchored in something immovable.

When I sing this now, it reminds me: the work happening underground is just as real—maybe more real—than the work visible above ground. And if I'll trust the process, keep showing up, keep putting roots down deep, the fruit will come.

In season. When roots are ready.

## Key Takeaways

- **Roots determine resilience.** Surface growth impresses, but deep roots sustain. When drought comes, shallow plants wither while deeply rooted trees stay green—not through effort, but through connection to living water.
- **Put pride, reactivity, isolation, and bitterness to death.** These keep roots shallow. Replace them with humility, responsiveness, connection, and forgiveness to create conditions for deep growth.
- **Remain in the vine; fruit follows naturally.** You don't manufacture spiritual fruit through striving. You stay connected to Jesus through sustained practices, and transformation flows from that abiding relationship.
- **Trust the hidden work.** The most important growth happens underground, unseen and unmeasured. Keep showing up, keep practicing, keep remaining—the roots are going deeper than you realize.

## Closing Image

You're standing at the base of an ancient tree. Massive. Towering. Its canopy spreads wide, providing shade for acres.

How long has this tree been here? A hundred years? Two hundred? More?

You walk closer and place your hand on the trunk. Solid. Rough. Weathered by countless storms. Scarred by lightning strikes. Marked by seasons of growth and seasons of pruning.

But still standing.

You look up into the branches. Birds nest there. Squirrels scamper. Life thrives in the shelter this tree provides.

And then you look down. At the base. Where roots disappear into the earth.

You can't see them. But you know they're there. Reaching deep. Spreading wide. Anchoring this massive tree so firmly that no storm can topple it.

The roots are why the tree stands.

This is the invitation: send your roots deep. Not for show. Not for applause. Not even for immediate fruit.

For stability. For resilience. For sustainable life.

The work happens underground. In the quiet. In the daily practices. In the sustained rhythms. In the patient trust.

You won't always see results. You won't always feel growth. You won't always sense progress.

But if you remain—if you keep showing up, keep practicing the disciplines, keep choosing connection over isolation, keep releasing bitterness and cultivating forgiveness—the roots will go deep.

And when heat comes, you won't fear. When drought arrives, you won't worry. When storms rage, you won't be uprooted.

Because your roots—hidden, deep, sustained by streams of living water—will hold.

Like a tree planted by streams of water. Leaves green. Fruit in season. Soul strong.

Deeply rooted in the love of God.

# Out of the Swamp: How I Found Truth (Chapter 10)


### MOVEMENT 3: UNFORCED RHYTHMS OF LIFE (The Transformation)
### Chapter 10: Redemption's Story

[Redemption Story](https://www.skylerthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Redemption-Story-Female.mp3)

**Listen at:** http://go.skylerthomas.com/MN36D4

![Scan to listen: Redemption Story](qr-ch11-redemption-story.png)


**An Invitation to See**

You've been through nine chapters now. The swamp. The water's edge. The rhythms. The roots. You've experienced rescue, cleansing, healing, and transformation.

But now I need to ask you something that might change how you see everything:

**What if your story isn't separate from THE story?**

What if the pain you've experienced has context? What if the waiting has meaning? What if the struggle isn't random?

Here's what I've discovered: **Your story—the swamp and the rescue, the breaking and the healing, the death and the rising—follows the same pattern as every redemption story ever told.**

Creation. Fall. Redemption. Restoration.

This isn't coincidence. It's the arc of reality itself. The shape of how grace works. The pattern woven into the fabric of existence.

You're not just surviving your circumstances. You're participating in the grand narrative of redemption that's been unfolding since before time began.

This chapter is about seeing your story within God's story. And when you do, everything stops being random.

The years in the swamp aren't just years you lost. They're the wilderness—like Israel in the desert, like Elijah in the cave, like David on the run. Necessary preparation for what comes next.

The water's edge isn't just a nice metaphor. It's baptism. It's Red Sea crossing. It's Jordan River moment. The place where the old dies and the new begins.

When you see your story within God's story, you start to live differently. With purpose. With hope. With perseverance. With mission.

So before you continue, pause. Consider:

*Can you say, even tentatively: "God, my story is part of Your story. The broken chapters, the painful seasons, the years I thought were wasted—they're all woven into the redemption arc You're writing. Help me see my life through that lens."*

That shift in perspective changes everything.

## Stories of Redemption

**The Redemption Promise in Eden (Genesis 3:15)**

The moment sin enters the world, God speaks a promise of redemption:

> "And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel."
> — Genesis 3:15

This is the first gospel proclamation. Even as God pronounces the curse, He promises redemption.

The entire Old Testament is the unfolding of this promise. Until finally, in the fullness of time, the Seed comes: Jesus, born of a woman, who crushes the serpent's head at the cross.

**Joseph's Story (Genesis 37-50)**

Joseph's story is one of the clearest pictures of "nothing is wasted" in all of Scripture.

Picture seventeen-year-old Joseph, his father's favorite, wearing the coat of many colors. His brothers hate him for it.

One day they grab him. Strip off the coat. Throw him into an empty cistern. They sell him to passing traders. Twenty shekels of silver.

Joseph ends up in Egypt as a slave. He works his way up, proves himself trustworthy—and Potiphar's wife propositions him. He refuses. She uses it as evidence: "He attacked me!"

Joseph goes to prison. An innocent man, imprisoned for doing the right thing. For years, he's there. He interprets dreams for fellow prisoners, asks to be remembered. But he's forgotten. Two more years pass.

Then Pharaoh has a dream. Joseph is brought from prison to palace in a single day. He interprets Pharaoh's dream—seven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine. Pharaoh puts him in charge.

The pit led to Potiphar's house. The prison led to the palace. And ultimately, Joseph's position saves not just Egypt, but his own family when they come begging for food during the famine.

When his brothers finally recognize him and fear his revenge, Joseph speaks words that capture the heart of redemption:

"You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives" (Genesis 50:20).

What others meant for evil, God meant for good. What looked like wasted years became the preparation for his purpose.

Nothing—not one moment of suffering—was wasted in God's economy.

**Peter's Denial and Restoration (Luke 22:31-32; John 21:15-19)**

Jesus had warned him: "Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift all of you as wheat. But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers."

Peter protested: "Lord, I'm ready to go with you to prison and to death!" But Jesus knew better: "Before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me."

Hours later, Jesus is arrested. Peter follows at a distance. A servant girl looks at him in the firelight. "This man was with him."

"Woman, I don't know him."

A little later: "You also are one of them."

"Man, I am not!"

About an hour passes. Another person insists: "Certainly this fellow was with him."

"Man, I don't know what you're talking about!"

Immediately, the rooster crows. Jesus turns and looks at Peter. Their eyes meet. And Peter remembers. He goes outside and weeps bitterly.

After the resurrection, Jesus finds Peter fishing. They cook breakfast on the beach. And Jesus restores Peter—three questions mirroring the three denials.

"Simon son of John, do you love me?"

"Yes, Lord, you know that I love you."

"Feed my lambs."

Three times Jesus asks. Three times Peter answers. Three times Jesus commissions him.

The threefold denial is answered with threefold restoration. The damage is redeemed.

**Paul's Transformation (Acts 9; 1 Timothy 1:12-16)**

Before his conversion, Saul of Tarsus is breathing out murderous threats against the Lord's disciples. He's hunting down Christians, dragging them to prison.

But on the road to Damascus, a light from heaven flashes around him. He falls to the ground.

"Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?"

"Who are you, Lord?"

"I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting."

The persecutor becomes the apostle. The one who tried to destroy the church becomes the one who builds it across the Roman Empire.

Paul never forgets his past. But he sees it redeemed:

> "I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man... But I was shown mercy... so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display his immense patience as an example for those who would believe."
> — 1 Timothy 1:13-16

His worst moments become testimonies to God's greatest grace. Nothing wasted.

## The Wayfarer Moment

**Seeing my story in THE story.**

For years, I thought my story was just mine. My struggles. My failures. My small attempts to get it right.

I'd read the Bible as ancient history—good for principles, maybe, but not personally connected to my everyday life.

But then I started to see it.

The pattern of my life—swamp, water's edge, dying, rising, rhythms, roots—wasn't unique to me. It was the redemption arc. The same arc that runs through Scripture from Genesis to Revelation.

I wasn't just struggling with personal sin. I was experiencing the fall.

I wasn't just crying out for help. I was participating in the pattern that echoes through the Psalms.

I wasn't just encountering grace. I was meeting the same God who met Moses, David, Peter, Paul.

I wasn't just dying to self. I was being united with Christ in His death and resurrection.

My story was part of THE story.

And when I saw that—really saw it—everything changed.

The pain I'd experienced wasn't meaningless. It was part of the redemption arc. God was using it to conform me to Christ's image.

The waiting seasons weren't wasted. They were necessary parts of the story. Times of preparation. Wilderness experiences that would later become testimonies.

The failures I'd carried with shame weren't the end of my story. They were chapters in a larger redemption narrative. Like Peter's denial. Like Paul's persecution. Like Joseph's pit.

God was redeeming them, transforming them into testimonies of grace.

The wayfarer moment came when I stopped seeing my life as disconnected events and started seeing it as a coherent narrative—my story woven into God's story.

I'm not the author. I'm a character. But I'm a beloved character in a story written by a good Author who knows how to turn crucifixions into resurrections.

I don't know how my particular story will unfold. I don't know what chapters are ahead.

But I know the Author. I know the arc. I know the ending.

Creation. Fall. Redemption. Restoration. Consummation.

And I know that in all things—ALL things—God is working for good. Nothing is wasted. Every pain has purpose. Every struggle is part of the redemption arc.

This is THE story. And by grace, it's my story too.

## Lyrics: Redemption Story

**[Chorus]**
From the beginning, His love was displayed,
Through every fall, His promise stayed.
A Savior's grace, a story divine,
Redemption secured for hearts like mine.

**[Verse 1]**
Before the stars adorned the night,
Before the sun gave earth its light,
The Word was spoken, creation came,
Through Jesus, the Maker, who knew our name.
He formed the earth, the skies, the seas,
Breathed life into humanity.
From dust we rose, His Spirit's flame,
To bear His image, to praise His name.

**[Chorus]**
From the beginning, His love was displayed,
Through every fall, His promise stayed.
A Savior's grace, a story divine,
Redemption secured for hearts like mine.

**[Verse 2]**
In Eden's garden, peace was found,
Until the serpent's lie unbound.
The fruit was taken, the fall began,
Sin entered the hearts of every man.
Yet even then, God's love remained,
A Savior promised to break the chain.
From Adam's sin to grace restored,
A plan of redemption from the Lord.

**[Chorus]**
From the beginning, His love was displayed,
Through every fall, His promise stayed.
A Savior's grace, a story divine,
Redemption secured for hearts like mine.

**[Verse 3]**
Through kings and prophets, His voice was heard,
Declaring His truth, His holy word.
David, the shepherd, a king would rise,
Through his line, the Savior arrive.
Isaiah spoke of a suffering King,
Who'd bear our sins and salvation bring.
Elijah's fire, Daniel's stand,
God's faithfulness across the land.

**[Chorus]**
From the beginning, His love was displayed,
Through every fall, His promise stayed.
A Savior's grace, a story divine,
Redemption secured for hearts like mine.

**[Bridge]**
Oh, the cross, where mercy flows,
The empty grave, the story shows.
Sin defeated, love prevailed,
Through Christ alone, redemption hailed.
Oh, the cross, where hope is found,
His grace abounds, His love profound.
He bore the weight, the debt was paid,
In Him, the victory's displayed.

**[Verse 4]**
Mary, chosen, her heart so pure,
Through her, God's love would long endure.
She held the Savior, her baby boy,
The King of kings, her heart's great joy.
Did she know the cross He'd face,
The pain, the nails, the world's disgrace?
Through grief, she trusted, through loss, she prayed,
Believing in the plan God made.

**[Verse 5]**
The leaders schemed, their hearts grew cold,
Blinded by power, they sought control.
They called Him a blasphemer, sentenced His death,
Yet love endured with His final breath.
Betrayed by a kiss for silver's gleam,
Denied by a friend in a broken dream.
Yet grace would triumph, death undone,
Victory through God's risen Son.

**[Verse 6]**
To die with Christ, to rise anew,
To walk His path, His love pursue.
The cross became the bridge to grace,
A gift of life in His embrace.
Through history's thread, His story flows,
A love eternal, a truth that grows.
My story now entwined with His,
A song of hope, a life that lives.

**[Final Chorus]**
From the beginning, His love was displayed,
Through every fall, His promise stayed.
A Savior's grace, a story divine,
Redemption secured for hearts like mine.

**[Outro]**
His story echoes through all of time,
A Savior's love, so pure, so kind.
One day we'll stand before His throne,
Forever redeemed, forever His own.

## Reflections for the Road

**Questions for the Journey:**

1. **Where do you see your story fitting into the redemption arc?**

   Look back at your life. Can you identify creation (who you were made to be), fall (your swamp), redemption (your water's edge), and restoration (the journey since then)?

2. **Read Romans 8:28-30 slowly.**

   "And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose..."

   Where do you see yourself in this redemption arc—called, justified, being glorified?

3. **What parts of your story feel wasted or meaningless?**

   The years in the swamp? The waiting seasons? The failures you still carry with shame? Name them specifically.

   Now read Genesis 50:20: "You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good." Can you trust that God is redeeming even those chapters?

4. **Whose redemption story gives you hope for yours?**

   Joseph betrayed by his brothers? Peter denying Jesus? Paul persecuting Christians? Someone you know personally?

   What does their story tell you about your own?

5. **How will you tell your redemption story to someone this week?**

   Not the whole thing. Maybe just one part—your swamp, your water's edge moment, or how God is restoring what felt wasted.

   Who needs to hear it? Name the person. When will you share it?

# Out of the Swamp: How I Found Truth (Chapter 11)


### MOVEMENT 3: UNFORCED RHYTHMS OF LIFE (The Transformation)
### Chapter 11: Nothing is Wasted

[Nothing is Wasted](https://www.skylerthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Nothing-is-Wasted-Remastered.mp3)

**Listen at:** http://go.skylerthomas.com/smBjeW

![Scan to listen: Nothing is Wasted](qr-ch12-nothing-wasted.png)


**An Invitation to Believe the Impossible**

You've come through ten chapters. You've seen your story within God's story. You've discovered purpose, rhythm, depth.

But now I need to ask you the hardest question yet:

**When you look back at your life—really look back—what do you see?**

Be honest. Do you see years in that toxic relationship? The job you stayed at too long? The ministry that blew up? The friendships you let die?

When you look back, do you see a timeline full of black holes? Years where nothing good grew. Just... waste?

Here's the question that haunts many of us: *Can God really redeem this? Or are some things just... lost?*

The enemy whispers: "Those years are gone. That potential is wasted. You can't get it back. It's too late."

But here's what I've discovered:

**In God's economy, nothing is wasted. Not "almost nothing." Not "most things." Nothing.**

Every tear. Every failure. Every lost year. Every broken relationship. Every season you wish you could erase—God can redeem it all.

This doesn't mean the pain wasn't real. It doesn't minimize the loss.

It means God specializes in turning crucifixions into resurrections. He takes what looks like absolute waste and transforms it into raw material for redemption.

So before you continue, pause. Consider:

*Can you say, even with doubt mixed in: "God, I don't see how You can redeem those years. But I'm willing to believe You can. Show me how nothing is wasted."*

## Key Themes

### 1. Timeline Reflection: Looking Back

Part of believing nothing is wasted is doing the hard work of timeline reflection.

This isn't nostalgia or rumination. It's intentionally asking:
- What moments brought joy?
- What moments brought pain?
- What patterns emerged?
- Where was grace at work even when I couldn't see it?

I've done this exercise multiple times over the years. Drew my timeline. Marked the major seasons.

And every time, I discover the same thing: grace was present even when I couldn't feel it. God was working even when I couldn't see it.

The years I thought were wasted? They taught me what I couldn't learn anywhere else. My desperate need for grace. Compassion for others who struggle. The cost of pride and the beauty of humility.

Even the wasted years became the very years that prepared me for the work I'm doing now.

### 2. Abraham and Isaac on Mount Moriah

Genesis 22 is one of the most challenging stories in Scripture. God asks Abraham to offer his son Isaac as a sacrifice.

Abraham obeys. He takes Isaac up Mount Moriah. Builds the altar. Binds his son. Raises the knife.

And God provides a ram in the thicket. Isaac is spared.

> "Abraham named the place Yahweh-Yireh (which means 'the LORD will provide'). To this day, people still use that name as a proverb: 'On the mountain of the LORD it will be provided.'"
> — Genesis 22:14 (NLT)

What could have been the most tragic waste becomes instead a revelation of God's character. The Lord provides. Always.

This is the promise for you: God specializes in last-minute provision. In turning what looks like absolute waste into absolute redemption.

The test itself wasn't wasted. The fear wasn't wasted. The faith required wasn't wasted.

All of it became part of the story told for generations: on the mountain of the Lord, it will be provided.

### 3. Romans 8:28 Rightly Understood

Perhaps no verse is more quoted—and more misunderstood—than Romans 8:28:

> "And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose."

This doesn't mean everything that happens is good. It doesn't mean God causes evil.

What it does mean: God is relentlessly committed to redeeming every moment of your story. Even the worst ones. Even the ones that feel utterly wasted.

God is at work, weaving them into something good.

I held this verse at arm's length for years. It felt like a platitude. Like minimizing real pain with Christian clichés.

But it's not a platitude. It's a promise. A promise that your pain has purpose. Your suffering isn't random. Your struggles aren't wasted.

God is working—actively, intentionally, lovingly—to bring good from it all.

> "God wastes nothing—not even sin. The soul that has struggled and come through is enriched by its struggle, and the grace of God is not frustrated."
> — Evelyn Underhill, *The Spiritual Life*

### 4. Suffering to Compassion

One of the most profound ways God ensures nothing is wasted is by transforming our suffering into compassion.

> "Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from God."
> — 2 Corinthians 1:3-4

Your pain isn't wasted when it becomes the bridge to someone else's healing.

Your struggle isn't wasted when it becomes the testimony that gives someone else hope.

I've seen this in my own life. The years I spent in the swamp? They weren't wasted. Because now when someone else is drowning, I can sit with them and say, "I've been here. I know this place. And there's a way out."

The toxic relationships I stayed in too long? They taught me about codependency, about people-pleasing. And now I can help others recognize those patterns before the damage goes as deep.

The ministry position that blew up? It taught me about burnout. And now I can warn others away from that cliff.

Nothing is wasted because every experience—even the painful ones—can become a gift to others.

## The Wayfarer Moment

**The shift from regret to redemption doesn't happen all at once. It happens one memory at a time.**

For years, I carried deep regret. Time wasted. Opportunities missed. Relationships broken. Years spent in patterns that brought nothing but pain.

I would look back and see waste. Just waste. And the weight of it was crushing.

But slowly—so slowly—I began to see differently. Not because the facts changed. But because my understanding of God's character deepened.

I started to ask different questions. Not "Why did I waste so much time?" but "Where was grace at work even when I couldn't see it?"

And the answers surprised me.

The years in the swamp taught me my desperate need for grace.

The mistakes taught me compassion for others who struggle.

The broken relationships taught me the cost of pride and the beauty of humility.

Even the wasted years became the very years that prepared me for the work I'm doing now.

Nothing was wasted. Not because I deserved redemption. But because God specializes in it.

I began doing timeline work—intentionally looking back at my life and tracing the thread of grace through every season.

And in every season, I found the same thing: God was there. Working. Weaving. Redeeming.

This didn't erase the pain. But it reframed the story.

What looked like waste became raw material for transformation.

What felt like lost years became the very years that made me who I am.

I'm learning to live from this truth: in the economy of God, nothing is wasted. Not the struggles. Not the failures. Not even the years I spent running from Him.

All of it—every moment, every tear, every broken piece—God is redeeming.

And if God can redeem my wasteland, He can redeem yours too.

## Lyrics: Nothing is Wasted

**[Verse 1]**
You asked me to let go of what I held too tight
The plans I made, the dreams I shaped, the pieces of my life
I tried to hold it all together, afraid of what I'd lose
But love means laying down the outcome
And trusting everything to You

**[Chorus]**
You will provide, You always do
Even when I don't know what You're leading me through
Even when I walk through fire, You stay in the flame
You hold my sorrow, You know my name
In the valley, in the waiting, I have tasted
In the economy of Your love, nothing is wasted

**[Verse 2]**
I've walked through days that felt like silence
And nights I couldn't catch my breath
I said I'd follow where You led me
But I was scared of what came next
I couldn't see beyond the moment
Still You whispered, "I am near"
You never promised all the answers
You only asked me not to fear

**[Chorus]**
You will provide, You always do
Even when I don't know what You're leading me through
Even when I walk through fire, You stay in the flame
You hold my sorrow, You know my name
In the valley, in the waiting, I have tasted
In the economy of Your love, nothing is wasted

**[Verse 3]**
So here I am with hands wide open
Letting go of what I thought was mine
You never asked me for perfection
Just a heart that says, "I'll try"
And in the breaking, I found healing
In the loss, I found Your grace
You're the God who turns my ashes
Into beauty I can't replace

**[Bridge]**
You don't waste the waiting, You don't waste the pain
Even when I'm walking through fire or rain
Every breath I breathe, every pain I've tasted
In the economy of Your love, nothing is wasted

**[Final Chorus]**
You will provide, You always do
Even when I'm breaking in two
Even when I walk through fire, You stay in the flame
You never leave me alone in the pain
In the valley, in the waiting, I have tasted
In the economy of Your love, nothing is wasted

**[Outro]**
So I lay it down again
Even when I don't understand
You are good... and nothing is wasted
You are near when I let go
You are strong when I feel low
You are kind... and nothing is wasted
You've seen every tear I've cried
Held my heart when hope had died
You stayed... and nothing is wasted
So I'll trust You in the silence
I'll believe You through the dark
You are faithful in the waiting
You are healing every part
I won't fear what comes tomorrow
I won't chase what's not mine to hold
You are God... and nothing is wasted

## Reflections for the Road

**Questions for the Journey:**

1. **What season of your life feels most "wasted"?** Name it. Where do you carry the most regret?

2. **Do timeline work.** Map your life in seasons. Mark the major ones. Where do you see patterns? Where do you see the thread of grace?

3. **What suffering might God want to transform into compassion?** Where have you been wounded? How might that pain become the bridge to someone else's healing?

4. **Read Genesis 22 and Romans 8:28 slowly.** What is God saying to you about provision and redemption?

# Epilogue: The Road Ahead

You've journeyed from swamp to water's edge to unforced rhythms. You've named your struggle, cried out in prayer, made the decision to stop and choose life, and discovered that dying to self changes everything.

You've been washed at the water's edge, learning what it means to live in the shadow of grace, receiving what you could never earn, and digging deeper into healing.

And you've begun to walk in the unforced rhythms of grace—sending roots deep, discovering redemption's story woven through your life, learning that nothing is wasted, standing firm because the devil is on the run, and living fully present in this moment.

But here's the truth I need you to hear before you close this book:

**This isn't the end. It's the beginning.**

The Christian life isn't about arriving at some final destination where everything is fixed and all questions are answered. It's about walking with Jesus—day by day, moment by moment, breath by breath.

There will be days when you feel like you're back in the swamp. When old patterns resurface. When shame whispers that you haven't really changed.

On those days, remember: you're not starting over. You're continuing forward. The work God began in you, He is faithful to complete (Philippians 1:6).

There will be days when grace feels distant. When you're exhausted from trying to live up to standards you were never meant to carry.

On those days, come back to the water's edge. Let grace wash over you again. It's not a one-time event—it's a daily returning to the truth of who you are in Christ.

There will be days when the rhythms feel forced. When life speeds up and you lose your footing in the chaos.

On those days, hear Jesus' invitation again: "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest" (Matthew 11:28). The rhythms are always unforced. The striving is always unnecessary. He is always enough.


## A Final Word

I don't know where you are right now. Maybe you're in the deepest part of the swamp, and this book felt like a lifeline. Maybe you're at the water's edge, tentatively stepping into grace. Maybe you're learning the rhythms and discovering that life with Jesus is better than you imagined.

Wherever you are, know this:

God isn't finished with you.
Grace is still sufficient.
This moment is still enough.

And the One who called you out of the swamp is faithful to walk with you every step of the way.

Keep walking, wayfarer.
The journey is just beginning.
