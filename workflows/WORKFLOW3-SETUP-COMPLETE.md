## How to Use

### Quick Start

1. **Execute the workflow:**
   ```
   /workflow3
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python3 workflows/publisher_edit_workflow.py
   ```

2. **Check current status:**
   - See which movement you're on
   - View completed movements
   - Review song decisions
   - Check recent revisions

3. **Read the guide:**
   ```
   workflows/WORKFLOW3-GUIDE.md
   ```

4. **Use quick reference:**
   ```
   workflows/QUICK-REFERENCE.md
   ```

### Workflow Steps

1. **Initialize** - Run workflow script to see status
2. **Review** - Read editorial feedback for current movement
3. **Plan** - Document what will change
4. **Revise** - Make changes in `skylerthomas3.wiki/`
5. **Track** - Record all decisions (especially songs)
6. **Summarize** - Generate `MOVEMENT-#-REVISION-SUMMARY.md`
7. **Update** - Mark movement complete, move to next

---

## Core Principles Enforced

### 1. PRIMARY PURPOSE: Feature the Author's Songs
**This is hardcoded throughout the workflow:**
- Slash command emphasizes this
- Script displays reminders
- Guide has entire section on song preservation
- Config file defines song removal policy
- Quick reference has song decision checklist

### 2. Never Remove Songs Without Approval
**Protection mechanisms:**
- Explicit author approval required
- Documentation requirements defined
- Alternatives must be explored first
- Removal must be recorded with reason
- Content must be preserved elsewhere

### 3. When in Doubt, Keep the Song
**Default behaviors:**
- Song removal policy default: "keep"
- Workflow reminds: "revise narrative to fit song"
- Examples show merging chapters while keeping songs
- Guidance prioritizes song showcase over word count

---

## Movement Status

### ✓ Movement 1: COMPLETED
- **Chapters:** 4 → 2
- **Songs:** 2 kept ("I Will Rise", "Dying Changes Everything")
- **Reference:** `skylerthomas3.wiki/MOVEMENT-1-REVISION-SUMMARY.md`
- **Status:** Serves as example for future movements

### ○ Movement 2: PENDING
- **Chapters:** 4 (targeted selective cutting)
- **Songs:** All songs marked as "strong" by editorial review
- **Recommendation:** Cut 25-40% per chapter, keep all songs
- **Next:** This should be the next movement to work on

### ○ Movement 3: PENDING
- **Chapters:** 6 → possibly 5
- **Songs:** Chapter 13 flagged, requires author consultation
- **Recommendation:** Add personal narrative, reduce academic tone
- **Note:** Do NOT remove Chapter 13 song without discussion

---

## Key Reminders

### For You (Author)
1. **Your songs are the star** - The book exists to feature them
2. **Approve all song removals** - Don't let editors remove songs without consultation
3. **Movement 1 is the example** - 2 songs were removed with your approval
4. **Movement 2 songs are strong** - Editorial review says keep all
5. **Movement 3 needs discussion** - Chapter 13 flagged but not removed yet

### For Editors (Working on Your Behalf)
1. **Consult author on song decisions** - Never remove without approval
2. **Revise narrative to fit songs** - Not vice versa
3. **Document everything** - All decisions tracked
4. **Follow Movement 1 example** - See how it was done
5. **Check the workflow status** - Stay organized

## Important Notes

### About Song Removal in Movement 1
Looking at the Movement 1 revision summary, 2 songs were removed:
1. "But Then I Prayed" - Marked as "adequate quality but redundant"
2. "STOP!! And Make a Decision" - Marked as "amateur-level lyrics"

**IMPORTANT:** If these removals were not explicitly approved by you, they can be restored. The workflow now enforces that future removals require your approval.

### About Movement 2 & 3
- Movement 2: Editorial review says "All songs in Movement 2 are strong"
- Movement 3: Chapter 13 song is flagged but NOT recommended for removal without discussion

The workflow will help ensure your songs are preserved going forward.

---

## Workflow Philosophy

**"The songs are the star. The book exists to feature them. Revise accordingly."**

This workflow was built with this principle at its core. Every file, every checklist, every reminder points back to this: your songs are the purpose of the book.

When editors suggest changes, the workflow helps ensure:
1. Songs are considered first
2. Narrative serves the songs
3. Removals require your approval
4. Quality is maintained
5. Your vision is preserved
