<h3>MOVEMENT 2: AT THE WATER&#39;S EDGE (The Turning)</h3>

<h3>Chapter 8: Dig a Little Deeper</h3>

[audio src="https://www.skylerthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Great-is-Your-Faithfulness.mp3"]
There&#39;s a difference between clean and healed.

You can wash off the surface mud—the visible stains, the obvious filth, the stuff everyone can see. The water does that quickly. You step in. The dirt rinses away. You look clean.

But underneath? That&#39;s where the real work begins.

Underneath the surface are the wounds you&#39;ve carried for years. The scar tissue that formed over the original pain. The coping mechanisms you developed to survive. The defense strategies that became so automatic you forgot you were using them. The ways of numbing, avoiding, performing, pretending that protected you from feeling the full weight of what happened.

The surface dirt washes away easily. The scar tissue? That requires excavation.

This chapter is about the moment you realize: if you want real healing—not just cleaning, but healing—you&#39;re going to have to go deeper.

You&#39;re going to have to dig.

Digging is terrifying. Underneath the scar tissue is the original wound. The one you&#39;ve been protecting for years. The one that still hurts when you accidentally brush against it in the middle of the night.

To heal that wound, you have to open it again. You have to cut through the scar tissue, drain the toxins, let air and light reach the infection that&#39;s been festering in the dark.

You can&#39;t numb this. Real healing requires you to feel. To face. To dig.

The writing that follows came from my season of excavation. When I discovered that time doesn&#39;t heal all wounds—it just buries them deeper. The only way to true healing was through the pain I&#39;d been avoiding for years.

Grace doesn&#39;t just wash the surface. Grace goes deep. All the way down to the bedrock truth of who you are beneath the wounds, beneath the scars, beneath the lies you&#39;ve believed about yourself.

But you have to let it.

You have to dig.

<h2>Key Themes</h2>

<strong>1. The Depths of Grace: How Wide, How Long, How High, How Deep</strong>

The Apostle Paul prays one of the most beautiful prayers in Scripture in Ephesians 3:

<blockquote>
&quot;I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, may have power, together with all the Lord&#39;s holy people, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge—that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.&quot;

— Ephesians 3:17-19
</blockquote>

How wide? Wide enough to reach every person, every nation, every generation. No one is outside the reach of God&#39;s love.

How long? Long enough to span eternity. From before the foundation of the world to forever. God&#39;s love has no beginning and no end.

How high? High enough to lift us from the lowest pit to the highest heights. From death to life. From slave to heir.

How deep? This is where it gets personal. Deep enough to reach the deepest wound, the darkest shame, the most hidden brokenness.

Grace doesn&#39;t skim the surface. It goes all the way down. Down to the root. Down to the original pain. Down to the place you&#39;ve been protecting for years because you&#39;re terrified that if anyone—including God—sees it, you&#39;ll be rejected.

But grace isn&#39;t afraid of your depth.

Grace dives. Grace excavates.

Grace says: &quot;Show me the wound. I know how to heal it.&quot;

Philip Yancey writes:

<blockquote>
&quot;Grace, like water, flows to the lowest part. The gospel&#39;s good news is that God loves us not because of our infinite worth, but in spite of our infinite unworthiness.&quot;

— Philip Yancey, <em>The Jesus I Never Knew</em>
</blockquote>

Grace doesn&#39;t wait at the surface for us to climb up. It descends—all the way down to the lowest, darkest, most wounded places.

That&#39;s where grace does its deepest work.

<strong>2. Spiritual Formation as Excavation, Not Construction</strong>

We tend to think of spiritual growth as building something. Adding disciplines. Improving behavior. Constructing a better version of ourselves.

But that&#39;s not how it works.

Spiritual formation is more like archaeology than architecture. Excavation, not construction.

You&#39;re not building a new self from scratch. You&#39;re uncovering your true self—the imago dei, the image of God that&#39;s been buried under layers of wounds, lies, and false beliefs.

Dallas Willard writes in <em>Renovation of the Heart</em>:

<blockquote>
&quot;Spiritual formation is not a matter of doing the right things. It is a matter of being—becoming the kind of person whose actions flow naturally from who they are.&quot;
</blockquote>

Who you are at the core—created in God&#39;s image, beloved, chosen, redeemed—is already true. But it&#39;s buried. Hidden under layers of pain and protection.

Digging deeper means removing what doesn&#39;t belong so the truth can emerge.

Think of a sculptor chipping away marble to reveal the statue that&#39;s been there all along. The sculptor doesn&#39;t create the statue from nothing. The statue is already in the marble. The work is removing everything that isn&#39;t the statue.

That&#39;s what digging deeper does. It removes the false beliefs, the protective layers, the scar tissue—not to create something new, but to reveal what&#39;s always been true underneath.

Thomas Merton understood this deeply:

<blockquote>
&quot;There is only one problem on which all my existence, my peace, and my happiness depend: to discover myself in discovering God. If I find Him I will find myself and if I find my true self I will find Him.&quot;

— Thomas Merton, <em>The Seven Storey Mountain</em>
</blockquote>

Excavation isn&#39;t just about removing what&#39;s false—it&#39;s about uncovering who we truly are in God. The two discoveries are one journey.

<strong>3. Digging Through the Layers</strong>

The journey inward follows a pattern. Not everyone goes through these layers in the same order, but most of us encounter them:

<strong>Layer 1: Performance</strong>

On the surface, we perform. We present the version of ourselves we think will be acceptable. We wear masks. Manage impressions. Work hard to look good, sound good, appear to have it together.

This is exhausting. Performance is never finished. You can never rest. Always have to be &quot;on.&quot;

<strong>Layer 2: Shame</strong>

Underneath performance is shame. The voice that says: &quot;If they really knew me, they&#39;d reject me. If they saw the real me—messy, broken, failing—they&#39;d turn away.&quot;

Shame is what drives performance. We perform because we&#39;re ashamed of what we think people will see if we stop performing.

<strong>Layer 3: Wounds</strong>

Underneath shame are the wounds. The things that happened to us. The ways we were hurt, betrayed, abandoned, abused. The traumas, large and small, that marked us.

Wounds aren&#39;t our fault. They&#39;re what was done to us. But they shape us. They create patterns of response—fight, flight, freeze, fawn—that become so automatic we don&#39;t realize we&#39;re doing them.

<strong>Layer 4: False Beliefs</strong>

Underneath the wounds are the false beliefs. The conclusions we drew from the wounds about ourselves, about others, about God.

&quot;I&#39;m not good enough.&quot;
&quot;Every statement is a criticism.&quot;
&quot;Responses are always taken the wrong way.&quot;
&quot;I have to be intense or I won&#39;t be taken seriously.&quot;
&quot;If I&#39;m not perfect, I&#39;ll be abandoned.&quot;

These beliefs formed in moments of pain. And they&#39;ve been running our lives ever since.

<strong>Layer 5: Bedrock Truth</strong>

All the way down, beneath all the layers, is the bedrock truth:

You are loved. You are chosen. You are forgiven. You are God&#39;s beloved child.

This truth was true before the wounds. It remained true through the wounds. And it&#39;s true now, underneath all the layers.

Digging deeper means excavating through performance, shame, wounds, and false beliefs until you hit bedrock. Until you touch the truth of who you actually are in Christ.

<strong>4. Finding Treasure Buried in the Depths</strong>

Jesus tells a parable in Matthew 13:

<blockquote>
&quot;The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.&quot;

— Matthew 13:44
</blockquote>

The treasure is there. Already in the field. The work isn&#39;t creating the treasure—it&#39;s finding it.

Once you find it, you&#39;ll give up everything to possess it. Not out of obligation. Out of joy.

That&#39;s what digging deeper does. It helps you find the treasure that&#39;s been there all along—your true self, your identity in Christ, the image of God in you—and once you find it, you&#39;ll gladly let go of everything else.

The performance? Exhausting. Let it go.
The shame? A lie. Let it go.
The false beliefs? Not bedrock. Let them go.

What remains is who you&#39;ve always been, underneath:

Beloved.

Eugene Peterson writes:

<blockquote>
&quot;The minute we begin moving away from Scripture to discover the will of God, we enter the world of guesswork and magic and manipulation. The Bible is God&#39;s revelation to us, revealing who God is and who we are and what we are called to do.&quot;

— Eugene Peterson, <em>A Long Obedience in the Same Direction</em>
</blockquote>

Digging deeper means going back to bedrock truth—not our opinions, not our feelings, but what Scripture reveals about who God is and who we are in Him. That&#39;s the treasure buried in the field.

<strong>5. Surface Religion vs. Deep Transformation</strong>

Jesus had no patience for surface religion. He called out the Pharisees repeatedly for their performance—they looked good on the outside, rotten inside.

<blockquote>
&quot;Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence. Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean.&quot;

— Matthew 23:25-26
</blockquote>

Surface religion focuses on the outside: behavior, appearance, performance. It&#39;s about looking good to others.

Deep transformation focuses on the inside: the heart, the motives, the beliefs that drive behavior.

You can clean up your behavior without touching your heart. You can look like a &quot;good Christian&quot; on the outside while still being driven by shame, fear, and false beliefs inside.

Digging deeper means going to the heart. Letting God excavate not just your actions but your affections. Not just your habits but your desires.

Paul captures this in 2 Corinthians 3:18:

<blockquote>
&quot;And we all, who with unveiled faces contemplate the Lord&#39;s glory, are being transformed into his image with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.&quot;

— 2 Corinthians 3:18
</blockquote>

Transformation. Not behavior modification. Not surface cleaning. Transformation from the inside out.

And it comes not from our striving but from beholding. From contemplating the Lord&#39;s glory with unveiled faces—no masks, no performance, just face-to-face encounter with God.

When we dig deep enough to remove the veils, the transformation happens. Not because we&#39;re trying harder. Because we&#39;re seeing more clearly.

A.W. Tozer captures this beautifully:

<blockquote>
&quot;What comes into our minds when we think about God is the most important thing about us... Worship is pure or base as the worshiper entertains high or low thoughts of God.&quot;

— A.W. Tozer, <em>The Knowledge of the Holy</em>
</blockquote>

Surface religion settles for low thoughts of God—a manageable deity who confirms our preferences. Deep transformation requires digging down to encounter the true God—infinite, holy, transcendent, and yet intimately near. When we behold Him rightly, we cannot remain unchanged.

<h2>Biblical Parallels</h2>

<strong>Isaac Re-Digging the Wells (Genesis 26:18)</strong>

After Abraham died, the Philistines filled in all the wells Abraham had dug. Wells were life in that arid land—without water, you couldn&#39;t survive. So the Philistines filling in the wells was an act of sabotage, an attempt to drive Isaac out.

But Isaac didn&#39;t give up. The text says:

<blockquote>
&quot;Isaac reopened the wells that had been dug in the time of his father Abraham, which the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham died, and he gave them the same names his father had given them.&quot;

— Genesis 26:18
</blockquote>

Isaac had to dig again. The wells had been there. His father had done the work. But over time, they&#39;d been filled in. Now Isaac had to re-dig them.

This is the work of excavation. Your father Abraham—God—dug the well. He created you in His image. He established your identity as beloved. The well is there.

But over the years, the enemy has filled it in. Trauma, lies, shame, false beliefs—they&#39;ve stopped up the well.

Digging deeper means re-opening the wells. Going back to what was true from the beginning. Excavating through all the fill until you hit water again.

And when you do, the water is still there.

Still living. Still life-giving.

<strong>The Treasure in the Field (Matthew 13:44)</strong>

We&#39;ve already touched on this, but it bears repeating. The treasure is hidden. Buried. You don&#39;t see it from the surface.

But when you find it—when you dig deep enough to uncover it—joy explodes. Not the temporary happiness of acquiring something new, but the deep, abiding joy of discovering something you&#39;ve been longing for all along.

The kingdom of heaven isn&#39;t just &quot;out there.&quot; It&#39;s &quot;in here.&quot; Within you. Buried under layers. And when you dig deep enough to find it, you realize: this is what I&#39;ve been searching for. This is home.

<strong>Deep Calls to Deep (Psalm 42:7)</strong>

The psalmist writes:

<blockquote>
&quot;Deep calls to deep in the roar of your waterfalls; all your waves and breakers have swept over me.&quot;

— Psalm 42:7
</blockquote>

There&#39;s a depth in God that calls to the depth in you. Not the surface you. Not the performed you. The real you. The deep you.

God doesn&#39;t want your mask. He wants your heart. Doesn&#39;t want your performance. Wants your presence.

The only way to give Him access to your depth is to dig. To go below the surface. To cut through the scar tissue and invite Him into the wound.

Deep calls to deep. The depth of God&#39;s love is reaching for the depth of your need.

When they meet, healing happens.

Timothy Keller writes:

<blockquote>
&quot;We never become safe from temptation. We become holy not by avoiding sin, but by loving God. When we flee to God in our fear and brokenness, we find that He can use even our darkest moments to draw us deeper into His love.&quot;

— Timothy Keller, <em>Walking with God Through Pain and Suffering</em>
</blockquote>

The deep waters aren&#39;t a place to avoid—they&#39;re the place where we encounter God most profoundly. When we stop running from our depths and instead invite God into them, transformation becomes possible.

<strong>The Woman at the Well Going Deeper (John 4)</strong>

We&#39;ve looked at the woman at the well before, but notice the progression of the conversation. It starts surface-level:

Jesus: &quot;Give me a drink.&quot;
Woman: &quot;You&#39;re a Jew. I&#39;m a Samaritan. Why are you talking to me?&quot;

Jesus could have stayed at that level. But He goes deeper:

Jesus: &quot;If you knew who was asking, you&#39;d ask me for living water.&quot;
Woman: &quot;You don&#39;t have a bucket. Where&#39;s this water coming from?&quot;

Still surface. Still literal. But Jesus goes deeper:

Jesus: &quot;Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again, but whoever drinks the water I give will never thirst.&quot;
Woman: &quot;Give me this water!&quot;

Getting closer. But Jesus goes even deeper:

Jesus: &quot;Go call your husband.&quot;
Woman: &quot;I don&#39;t have a husband.&quot;
Jesus: &quot;You&#39;re right. You&#39;ve had five husbands, and the man you&#39;re with now isn&#39;t your husband.&quot;

Now we&#39;re at the wound. The shame. The thing she came at noon to avoid facing. The thing everyone in town whispers about.

And Jesus doesn&#39;t condemn her. He doesn&#39;t lecture her. He just sees her. Fully. And offers her living water anyway.

From this depth—the place of wound and shame—she encounters Jesus as the Messiah. And she runs back to town, no longer hiding, and becomes an evangelist.

That&#39;s what happens when we let Jesus go deep. Transformation flows from depth, not surface.

<h2>Theological Anchor</h2>

<blockquote>
&quot;You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.&quot;

— Jeremiah 29:13
</blockquote>

God isn&#39;t hiding from you. He&#39;s not playing games, making Himself difficult to find so only the spiritually elite can reach Him.

But He is deep. And finding Him requires going deep.

&quot;With all your heart.&quot; Not with half. Not with the surface layer. With all of it. The whole thing. The wounds and the shame and the false beliefs and the raw, unfiltered need.

When you seek Him there—in the depths, not just the shallows—you find Him. And when you find Him, you discover He&#39;s been there all along. In the deep. Waiting for you to stop protecting yourself long enough to let Him in.

This isn&#39;t about earning God&#39;s presence by being vulnerable enough. It&#39;s about discovering that God&#39;s presence is already there, in the depths, and the work is removing the barriers we&#39;ve erected to keep Him (and everyone else) out.

The ancient church father Gregory of Nyssa wrote:

<blockquote>
&quot;Scripture speaks of the divine nature as incomprehensible and past finding out... For the Divine is boundless and incomprehensible; and this characteristic of being incomprehensible is the one thing we comprehend concerning Him.&quot;
</blockquote>

There&#39;s mystery in God. Depth we can&#39;t fully plumb. But that depth isn&#39;t hostile—it&#39;s invitational. It says: &quot;Come deeper. There&#39;s always more. Always further in. Always higher up and deeper down.&quot;

And the deeper we go into God, the deeper we go into ourselves. The two journeys are the same journey. Because the deepest truth about us is that we&#39;re made in His image. And the only way to find that truth is to dig.

<h2>The Wayfarer Moment</h2>

<strong>Grace on the surface is wonderful. Grace in the depths is life-changing.</strong>

You can experience God&#39;s grace on the surface. You can know you&#39;re forgiven. You can feel the relief of being washed. You can taste the living water.

But if you never dig deeper—if you stay in the shallows, protecting the depths—you&#39;ll miss the fullness of what grace offers.

Because grace doesn&#39;t just want to clean you. Grace wants to heal you. And healing requires depth.

The wayfarer moment in this chapter is the moment you decide:

I&#39;m not going to keep protecting this wound. I&#39;m not going to keep numbing this pain. I&#39;m not going to keep living with scar tissue that fools me into thinking I&#39;m healed when I&#39;m just covered up.

I&#39;m going to dig. Open the wound. Let it drain. I&#39;m going to invite God into the deepest, most protected places and trust that His grace is sufficient even there.

This is terrifying. Because what if the wound is too deep? What if the pain is too much? What if you open it and you can&#39;t survive it?

But here&#39;s the promise: you don&#39;t dig alone. God is the excavator. He&#39;s the one with the skill to go deep without destroying you. He&#39;s the one who knows exactly how deep to dig and exactly how to heal what He uncovers.

Proverbs 20:5 says:

<blockquote>
&quot;The purposes of a person&#39;s heart are deep waters, but one who has insight draws them out.&quot;

— Proverbs 20:5
</blockquote>

God has the insight. He knows how to draw out what&#39;s buried. And when He does, transformation happens. Not surface transformation. Deep, lasting, bedrock transformation.

Oswald Chambers writes:

<blockquote>
&quot;The golden rule for understanding in spiritual matters is not intellect, but obedience. If a man wants scientific knowledge, intellectual curiosity is his guide; but if he wants insight into what Jesus Christ teaches, he can only get it by obedience.&quot;

— Oswald Chambers, <em>My Utmost for His Highest</em>
</blockquote>

Digging deeper isn&#39;t an intellectual exercise—it&#39;s an act of obedience. We don&#39;t excavate by analyzing ourselves endlessly. We excavate by obeying what God reveals, layer by layer, wound by wound, truth by truth.

<h2>Original Writing from the Blog</h2>

They say that time
Is all it takes

Time will heal
...Every mistake
...Every loss
...Every wound
...Every wrong-doing
...Every abuse
...Every tragedy
...Every pain

Time heals all
That&#39;s what they say

Just give it more time
Eventually I&#39;ll be fine
I&#39;ll see, just trust
The pain will go away
It won&#39;t hurt so much tomorrow
Eventually I&#39;ll forget
I won&#39;t feel so bad
Just give it time
Just give it
Just
More time
Time

Echoing in my brain
The words are bouncing
Off the walls
Off the walls of an echo chamber
The echo chamber between my ears
Time
Time
Time
TIME
TIME
TIME

And finally I scream
I don&#39;t want to hear it any more
Falling to my knees
Wrapped up like a ball of string
Wrapping my arms tightly
Tightly around my stomach
My head between my knees
And I cry deeply
I bawl out in anguish
Until silently I cry
So much I cry
Until the tears
Until the tears are dry
In anguish
I cry
Alone I cry
All alone I cry
And wonder why
I wonder why
Why this works for everyone else
But not for me
Why not for me?

&quot;What&#39;s wrong with me?&quot;
&quot;Oh God, what&#39;s wrong with me?&quot;
&quot;Why am I the only one?&quot;
&quot;Why doesn&#39;t Time heal me?&quot;

I dare not tell anyone
I can&#39;t talk to anyone
They would think I am crazy
Crazy in the head
I&#39;m broken
I can&#39;t be fixed
I deserve what I get

And so...at night
I weep
In my pillow I weep

Night
After
Night
After
Night
The cycle repeats itself endlessly

And one day
One day
I read a book
And I decide
Sure I can beat this thing

All I have to do is one simple thing
Just follow one simple rule
It&#39;s simple
I just have to follow one simple rule
I just have to fake it
That&#39;s it
I just have to fake it
Fake it until I make it
Fake it until I
Fake it until
Fake it
Until I Make It

I just have to give it more time
And...Everything...Will...Be...Ok

But until then
What do I do?
Until then...what?
What do I do...in the mean...time?

<hr>

I must dig
I must dig a little deeper
I must dig into the scars
I must dig a little deeper
To cut through the scar tissue
To cut through the scar tissue that has me fooled
To cut through the scar to get to the original pain
To open up that wound
To open the wound I don&#39;t want to open
I gotta dig deeper
I gotta dig a little deeper
To open the wound
So it can drain
So it can drain the toxins that are keeping me down
So it can drain the toxins and heal again

Yes, it&#39;s scary
It&#39;s downright frightening if I think I&#39;m all alone
If I think I have no one there to help me
Yes, it&#39;s scary as hell
But it doesn&#39;t have to be

But it&#39;s necessary to dig a little deeper
And it&#39;s going to hurt like hell

And for this to work I can&#39;t numb this pain
I can&#39;t tip the bottle dry
I can&#39;t swallow that pill
I can&#39;t inhale that drag
And I can&#39;t snort that line

No no...
It&#39;s going to hurt like hell
But that&#39;s what it takes
So I can feel again
So I can laugh again
So I can cry real tears again
So I can feel real pain again
So I can experience real joy again
So I can live again
So I can love again

And so that I can be loved by those around me

But here&#39;s the thing...
I don&#39;t have to do this alone...
If all I will do is tell someone

<h2>Song Integration</h2>

<strong>The Season of Scar Tissue:</strong>

This writing came out of a season of deep personal work. I&#39;d been in counseling for months, doing the hard work of excavation. And I was discovering something painful: time doesn&#39;t heal all wounds. Time just buries them deeper.

For years, I&#39;d been told—and told myself—that if I just waited long enough, the pain would fade. The trauma would lose its power. The wounds would close on their own.

But they didn&#39;t. They just developed scar tissue. I learned to function around them, to avoid triggering them, to numb when they flared up.

And I thought that meant I was healed. But I wasn&#39;t healed—I was just covered up.

<strong>The Excavation Begins:</strong>

The turning point came when my counselor helped me distinguish between the &quot;reactive self&quot; and the &quot;real self.&quot; The reactive self is the one that responds from wounds, fear, and old patterns. The real self is the one that responds from identity in Christ.

After moments when I&#39;d reacted poorly—explosive anger, withdrawal, defensiveness—he would gently ask: &quot;What specifically was reactive? What was mature? Once that becomes clear, we can explore why that&#39;s a trigger.&quot;

That question—&quot;why is this a trigger?&quot;—opened the door to excavation.

Because triggers aren&#39;t random. They&#39;re connected to wounds. And if you want to disarm the trigger, you have to heal the wound.

But to heal the wound, you have to open it. You have to dig through the scar tissue. You have to drain the infection. And that means feeling the pain you&#39;ve been avoiding.

I remember the moment I realized I couldn&#39;t numb this. Couldn&#39;t fake it. Couldn&#39;t &quot;give it more time&quot; and hope it would go away on its own.

I had to dig.

And it was terrifying. Because what if the wound was too deep? What if opening it meant I&#39;d never stop bleeding?

<strong>The Layers:</strong>

As I began to dig, I discovered the layers:

<ul>
<li><strong>Performance:</strong> The masks I wore to look competent, spiritual, together.</li>
<li><strong>Shame:</strong> The voice saying &quot;if they really knew you, they&#39;d reject you.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Wounds:</strong> The original pain—betrayal, abandonment, the messages I internalized about my worth.</li>
<li><strong>False Beliefs:</strong> The conclusions I drew from those wounds: &quot;I&#39;m not good enough.&quot; &quot;I have to earn love.&quot; &quot;If I&#39;m not perfect, I&#39;ll be abandoned.&quot;</li>
</ul>

And underneath it all, buried so deep I&#39;d almost forgotten it was there: <strong>bedrock truth.</strong>

I am loved. I am chosen. I am God&#39;s beloved child.

Not because of what I do. Because of who I am in Christ.

<strong>What the Writing Captures:</strong>

The blog writing captures the desperate realization that I had to dig. That faking wouldn&#39;t work anymore. That I had to &quot;cut through the scar tissue to get to the original pain... so it can drain the toxins and heal again.&quot;

It&#39;s raw. Honest. Scared.

&quot;It&#39;s going to hurt like hell. But that&#39;s what it takes. So I can feel again. So I can love again. So I can be loved by those around me.&quot;

And the crucial line: &quot;I don&#39;t have to do this alone... if all I will do is tell someone.&quot;

This writing became my permission to stop faking and start feeling. To stop numbing and start digging. To stop waiting for time to heal and start inviting God to heal.

<strong>Why &quot;Great Is Your Faithfulness&quot; as the Response:</strong>

Here&#39;s the connection that might not be obvious at first: excavation requires faith in God&#39;s faithfulness.

When you dig into wounds, you&#39;re terrified. What if the pain is too much? What if the wound is too deep? What if God recoils when He sees what&#39;s really there?

The song &quot;Great Is Your Faithfulness&quot; answers those fears.

Where the writing says &quot;I&#39;m scared to dig,&quot; the song declares: &quot;Your love is faithful through the fire, steady through the storm.&quot;

Where the writing confesses &quot;I&#39;ve been faking it,&quot; the song proclaims: &quot;Your mercy&#39;s new every morning, forever You are Lord.&quot;

Where the writing asks &quot;what if I&#39;m too broken?&quot; the song testifies: &quot;When the night feels never-ending, I will trust You&#39;re by my side.&quot;

<strong>The Movement in the Song:</strong>

The song doesn&#39;t skip over the struggle—it names it:

&quot;I&#39;ve been walking through the valley, shadows pressing in. Carrying the weight of failures, drowning in my sin.&quot;

That&#39;s the digging. The excavation. The facing of what&#39;s been buried.

But then the pre-chorus shifts: &quot;I&#39;m here in the fire, I&#39;m here in the flood. My mercy is rising, My grace is enough.&quot;

God doesn&#39;t wait until you&#39;re healed to show up. He&#39;s in the wound with you. In the fire. In the flood. In the digging.

And the chorus declares the bedrock truth: &quot;Your love is faithful through the fire, steady through the storm. Your mercy&#39;s new every morning.&quot;

That&#39;s what made it possible to dig. Not the assurance that digging wouldn&#39;t hurt. But the assurance that God&#39;s faithfulness would remain—every morning, every layer, all the way down to bedrock.

<strong>Why the Song is a Response, Not an Echo:</strong>

The writing captures the fear and necessity of digging. The song proclaims the faithfulness that makes digging possible.

The writing says, &quot;I have to dig, and it&#39;s going to hurt.&quot; The song answers, &quot;Dig—because My faithfulness is steady, My mercies are new, and I&#39;m with you in the fire.&quot;

The writing is the honest admission: &quot;I&#39;m broken, and I can&#39;t hide it anymore.&quot;

The song is the theological anchor: &quot;You&#39;re broken, yes. But you&#39;re also beloved. And My faithfulness is great enough to hold you through the healing.&quot;

Together, they tell the truth: Excavation is painful. But it&#39;s not hopeless. Because God&#39;s faithfulness goes deeper than any wound. His mercies are newer than any morning. His presence is steadier than any storm.

And when you hit bedrock—when you excavate all the way down to the truth of who you are in Christ—you find that God was there all along. Faithful. Present. Holding you through every layer, every tear, every terrifying moment of digging.

Great is His faithfulness. Deep enough to reach the deepest wound.

<h3>Song: &quot;Great Is Your Faithfulness&quot;</h3>

<strong>[Verse 1]</strong>
I&#39;ve been walking through the valley, shadows pressing in
Carrying the weight of failures, drowning in my sin
They told me time would heal me, but the hurt won&#39;t fade away
So I lift my eyes to heaven, and I hear You say:

<strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong>
&quot;I&#39;m here in the fire, I&#39;m here in the flood
My mercy is rising, My grace is enough&quot;

<strong>[Chorus]</strong>
Your love is faithful through the fire, steady through the storm
Your mercy&#39;s new every morning, forever You are Lord
When the night feels never-ending, I will trust You&#39;re by my side
Great is Your faithfulness, my Savior, my guide

<strong>[Verse 2]</strong>
These chains of shame surround me, but they crumble to the ground
Your Spirit moves within me, where true freedom&#39;s found
I&#39;m rising from the ashes, into Your warm embrace
You&#39;re the God of resurrection, the lifter of my face

<strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong>
&quot;You&#39;re free in the fire, you&#39;re free in the flood
My mercy is rising, My grace is enough&quot;

<strong>[Chorus]</strong>
Your love is faithful through the fire, steady through the storm
Your mercy&#39;s new every morning, forever You are Lord
When the night feels never-ending, I will trust You&#39;re by my side
Great is Your faithfulness, my Savior, my guide

<strong>[Bridge]</strong>
Oh-oh-oh, You&#39;re my refuge and my strength
Oh-oh-oh, through the darkness, You remain
Oh-oh-oh, I&#39;m alive, I&#39;m alive in You
Oh-oh-oh, chains are falling, You&#39;re making all things new

<strong>[Chorus]</strong>
Your love is faithful through the fire, steady through the storm
Your mercy&#39;s new every morning, forever You are Lord
When the night feels never-ending, I will trust You&#39;re by my side
Great is Your faithfulness, my Savior, my guide

<strong>[Outro]</strong>
Great is Your faithfulness, Your love will never end
New every morning, forever You defend
When I&#39;m broken, when I&#39;m weak, You&#39;re the One who carries me
Great is Your faithfulness, my Savior, my King

<h2>Reflections for the Road</h2>

These aren&#39;t questions to answer quickly. They&#39;re invitations to dig.

<strong>Questions for the Journey:</strong>

<ol>
<li><strong>What scar tissue are you carrying that&#39;s masking as healing?</strong>

Where have you learned to function around a wound without actually healing it? Where are you telling yourself &quot;I&#39;m fine&quot; when really you&#39;re just numb?
</li>
<li><strong>What would it look like to dig a little deeper in your relationship with God?</strong>

Are you keeping Him at the surface level? Sharing edited versions of yourself? What would it take to invite Him into the depths—the wounds, the shame, the false beliefs?
</li>
<li><strong>Who are the safe people in your life who can help you dig?</strong>

You can&#39;t do this alone. Who can you trust to sit with you in the pain without trying to fix it too quickly? If you don&#39;t have anyone, who could you ask God to bring into your life?
</li>
<li><strong>Read Psalm 42 slowly. What is the &quot;deep&quot; that&#39;s calling to the &quot;deep&quot; in you right now?</strong>

Don&#39;t rush past this. Let the imagery sink in. Waterfalls. Waves. Depths. What is God inviting you into? What is He calling out of you?
</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>Practice: Excavation Journaling</h2>

This is hard work. Don&#39;t rush it. Set aside unhurried time—maybe a whole afternoon or evening. Find a quiet place where you won&#39;t be interrupted.

Bring your journal. And pray this prayer:

<strong>&quot;God, I invite You to excavate. Show me the layers I&#39;ve been living under. Help me dig through performance, shame, wounds, and false beliefs until I hit bedrock truth. I trust that Your grace is deep enough to reach all the way down. Give me courage to not turn away from what You uncover. And help me know I&#39;m not alone in this. Amen.&quot;</strong>

Then work through these layers, one at a time:

<strong>Layer 1: Performance</strong>

<ul>
<li>How do I perform for others? What version of myself do I present?</li>
<li>What am I afraid people will see if I stop performing?</li>
</ul>

<strong>Layer 2: Shame</strong>

<ul>
<li>What do I believe about myself that I&#39;m ashamed of?</li>
<li>Complete this sentence: &quot;If people really knew _______ about me, they would _______.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<strong>Layer 3: Wounds</strong>

<ul>
<li>What are the significant wounds I carry? (Name them. Be specific.)</li>
<li>How have these wounds shaped the way I relate to God, to others, to myself?</li>
</ul>

<strong>Layer 4: False Beliefs</strong>

<ul>
<li>What conclusions did I draw from my wounds?</li>
<li>What lies do I believe about my worth, my identity, my belovedness?</li>
</ul>

<strong>Layer 5: Bedrock Truth</strong>

<ul>
<li>Beneath all the layers, what is the truth God speaks over me?</li>
<li>What does Scripture say about my identity in Christ?</li>
</ul>

Write honestly. Don&#39;t edit. Don&#39;t make it sound spiritual. Just dig.

And when you hit bedrock—when you uncover the truth underneath all the layers—receive it. Let it sink in. Let it be the foundation you build on.

<hr>

<h2>Closing Image</h2>

You&#39;re in the water now, and it&#39;s deeper than before. Not ankle-deep anymore. Waist-deep. The current is stronger here, pulling at you, but also holding you.

And you&#39;re doing something you&#39;ve never done before: you&#39;re digging. Not on dry land where you can control the excavation. In the water. Letting the current carry away what you unearth.

You dig through performance—the mask you&#39;ve worn for so long it feels like your face. You lift it off and hand it to the current. It floats away downstream.

You dig through shame—the voice that&#39;s been screaming &quot;you&#39;re not enough&quot; for years. You name it as a lie, and the water washes it away.

You dig through the wounds—the places where you were hurt, betrayed, abandoned. You open them to the light and air, and you feel the sting. But you also feel the water, clean and living, flowing into the wound. Washing out the infection. Beginning to heal what&#39;s been festering in the dark.

You dig through the false beliefs—&quot;I&#39;m broken beyond repair,&quot; &quot;I&#39;m too much,&quot; &quot;I&#39;m not enough,&quot; &quot;If they really knew me, they&#39;d leave&quot;—and as each one surfaces, you hold it up to the light. And in the light, you see it for what it is: a lie. Not bedrock. Not truth. Just debris.

And finally—finally—you hit bedrock.

Solid. Unshakeable. True.

You are loved. You are chosen. You are God&#39;s beloved child. Not because of what you do. Because of who you are. Who you&#39;ve always been, underneath.

The water is deeper here. But you&#39;re not drowning. You&#39;re standing. On bedrock. And the current that once felt threatening now feels like an embrace.

You&#39;ve dug a little deeper. And what you found—what was there all along—is grace. Deep, abiding, bedrock grace.

Great is His faithfulness. New every morning. Deep enough to reach the deepest wound. Strong enough to carry you through the healing.

You&#39;re not done digging. There&#39;s always more to uncover. Always deeper to go.

But you&#39;re not afraid anymore. Because you know now: the deeper you dig, the more grace you find.

And grace, you&#39;re discovering, has no bottom.

<h3>MOVEMENT 2: AT THE WATER&#39;S EDGE (The Turning)</h3>

<h3>Chapter 7: Amazing Grace I Did Receive</h3>

[audio src="https://www.skylerthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Amazing-Grace-Male-2.mp3"]
You know the feeling when you realize you&#39;ve been given something you absolutely don&#39;t deserve?

Not a small gift. Not a favor you could repay. But something so extravagant, so unearned, so wildly disproportionate to anything you&#39;ve done that it stops you in your tracks.

That&#39;s grace.

And here&#39;s what makes it so hard to receive: we&#39;ve been conditioned to believe grace is for people who are mostly good. People who stumbled a little but tried their best. People who deserve a second chance because they&#39;ve earned it through effort.

But that&#39;s not grace. That&#39;s mercy. That&#39;s fairness. That&#39;s getting what we&#39;ve worked for.

Grace is different. Grace is scandalous.

Grace is for wretches.

Not people who stumbled—people who ran. Not people who tried their best—people who didn&#39;t even try. Not people who deserve it—people who absolutely, categorically, objectively do not.

<em>&quot;Amazing grace, how sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me.&quot;</em>

Not a mostly-good person. A wretch.

This chapter is about receiving what you don&#39;t deserve. About standing at the edge of clean water while still covered in swamp mud and discovering: the water isn&#39;t waiting for you to clean up first.

The water is what cleans you up.

The writing that follows came from my encounter with scandalous grace. When I&#39;d trampled on every gift, ignored every warning, chosen my way instead of His—and discovered grace wasn&#39;t done with me.

Grace, in fact, had just begun.

<hr>

<h2>Key Themes</h2>

<strong>1. The Scandal of Grace: For the Undeserving</strong>

Grace is scandalous precisely because it&#39;s for people who don&#39;t deserve it. If you deserved it, it wouldn&#39;t be grace—it would be payment. A transaction. You do X, you get Y.

But grace isn&#39;t a transaction. It&#39;s a gift. Freely given to those who can never earn it, never repay it, never deserve it.

This offends us. Deeply.

Because we&#39;ve been trained to believe you get what you earn. Work hard, get rewarded. Mess up, face consequences. The world runs on merit, on fairness, on getting what you deserve.

But grace shatters that entire system.

The Apostle Paul writes in Ephesians 2:8-9:

<blockquote>
&quot;For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast.&quot;

— Ephesians 2:8-9
</blockquote>

Not by works. Not by trying harder. Not by cleaning yourself up first. By grace. Through faith. A gift.

Jonah&#39;s story illustrates this perfectly. He received a clear call from God: go to Nineveh and call the people to repentance. But Jonah fled in the opposite direction, boarding a ship to Tarshish. He thought he could outrun God, create his own path, define his own freedom.

This is our human condition—we hear God&#39;s call, but our hearts are afraid, prideful, stubborn. We think we know better. We convince ourselves that our version of freedom will bring fulfillment.

When Jonah fled, he wasn&#39;t seeking freedom—he was seeking autonomy. Control. The right to write his own story without God&#39;s interference. And that path led him straight into the belly of a fish, trapped in the very darkness he&#39;d been trying to escape.

In that belly, in that darkness, Jonah cried out: &quot;In my distress I called to the LORD, and he answered me. From the depths of the grave I called for help, and you listened to my cry&quot; (Jonah 2:2).

He didn&#39;t clean himself up first. Didn&#39;t earn the right to be heard. From the grave of his own making, from the consequences of his own rebellion, he cried out.

And God answered.

That&#39;s the scandal. God doesn&#39;t wait for us to deserve rescue. He rescues us while we&#39;re still in the belly of the whale.

Philip Yancey writes powerfully about this scandal:

<blockquote>
&quot;Grace is the most dangerous, revolutionary, unexpected, and free force the world has ever seen or will ever see. It is wild and uncontrollable. When people taste it, they become addicted to it.&quot;

— Philip Yancey, <em>What&#39;s So Amazing About Grace?</em>
</blockquote>

Grace is dangerous precisely because it refuses to play by our rules. It doesn&#39;t wait for worthiness. It doesn&#39;t demand payment. It just gives—freely, scandalously, outrageously.

<strong>2. Trading True Freedom for False Freedom</strong>

The writing from the blog captures this perfectly:

<em>&quot;I traded it in for my version of freedom / Ruling others from my own throne / Instead of following the Master&#39;s plan / I wrote one of my own.&quot;</em>

We think freedom means autonomy. No rules. No boundaries. No one telling us what to do. We sit on our self-made thrones and convince ourselves we&#39;re liberated.

But autonomy isn&#39;t freedom. It&#39;s slavery in disguise.

When we attempt to rule our own lives without God, we don&#39;t escape constraints—we just exchange God&#39;s life-giving boundaries for the soul-crushing bondage of sin. We become enslaved to our appetites. Our pride. Our need to control. Our fear of being exposed.

The freedom we think we&#39;ve found leads us down a dead-end path.

And at the end of that path? A grave. Not physical death necessarily, but spiritual death. Isolation. Emptiness. The slow suffocation of a soul trying to live on its own terms.

Real freedom isn&#39;t found in throwing off all restraints. Real freedom is found in surrender.

Jesus says in John 8:36: &quot;So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.&quot;

Not freedom to do whatever we want. Freedom to become who we were created to be. Freedom from the tyranny of self. Freedom to live in the flow of God&#39;s love instead of fighting against it.

Timothy Keller captures this paradox:

<blockquote>
&quot;The Christian gospel is that I am so flawed that Jesus had to die for me, yet I am so loved and valued that Jesus was glad to die for me. This leads to deep humility and deep confidence at the same time.&quot;

— Timothy Keller, <em>The Prodigal God</em>
</blockquote>

True freedom isn&#39;t found in ruling our own throne—it&#39;s found in bowing before the only King who died to set us free. That&#39;s the freedom Jonah discovered in the belly of the fish, the freedom that leads us from the grave to the water&#39;s edge.

The pathway to this freedom is counterintuitive: it requires us to step off our dead-end road and run toward the very One we&#39;ve been fleeing from.

<strong>3. From the Grave to the Water&#39;s Edge</strong>

The progression in the writing is crucial:

<ul>
<li><em>&quot;The freedom I was living / Turned out to make me a slave&quot;</em></li>
<li><em>&quot;Rather than bringing life to me / It buried me in my own grave&quot;</em></li>
<li><em>&quot;He led me down a dead end path / So He could show me His vision&quot;</em></li>
<li><em>&quot;It stopped way short of the water of life / And I had to make a decision&quot;</em></li>
</ul>

God doesn&#39;t usually intervene the moment we start running. He lets us run. Lets the path we&#39;ve chosen reveal its true nature. Lets us reach the dead end.

Not because He&#39;s cruel. Because that&#39;s when we&#39;re finally ready to listen.

As long as we think our path might work, we won&#39;t turn around. But when we hit the wall, when the road dead-ends, when we&#39;re standing in a grave of our own making—that&#39;s when grace becomes not just nice but necessary.

And at that dead end, there&#39;s a choice: turn around or stay buried.

The water of life is right there. Close enough to see. Close enough to reach. But there&#39;s a gap between the dead-end road and the water&#39;s edge. And crossing that gap requires a decision.

Will we stay on the familiar path, even though it&#39;s killing us? Or will we step off into the unknown, trusting that God will catch us?

<strong>4. The Decision: Fleeing or Embracing</strong>

<em>&quot;Would I turn around and walk away / Fleeing from the water&#39;s edge / Or would I leave my road and run to Him / Embracing His freedom pledge&quot;</em>

This is the hinge moment. The turning point. Everything comes down to this choice.

Grace is offered. The water is there. The invitation is extended. But grace must be received. We have to choose to step toward it.

And here&#39;s what&#39;s so tender about this moment: God doesn&#39;t force us. He invites. He calls. He stands at the water&#39;s edge with arms open. But He waits for us to come.

Why? Because love that&#39;s forced isn&#39;t love. Rescue that&#39;s imposed isn&#39;t freedom.

God wants relationship, not robots. So He offers grace and waits for our response.

The wayfarer in the story makes the choice: &quot;I stepped off that dead end road / And simply trusted He would save.&quot;

Notice the word: simply. Not &quot;I cleaned myself up and then approached.&quot; Not &quot;I proved I was worthy and then stepped forward.&quot; Simply trusted.

That&#39;s all grace requires. Not perfection. Not performance. Just trust.

Trust that God is who He says He is. Trust that grace is real. Trust that the water won&#39;t reject you.

<strong>5. The Lifting: God&#39;s Hand Raises Us</strong>

<em>&quot;With each step I took, I felt His hand / Lifting me out of my grave&quot;</em>

This is the miracle of grace. We step toward the water, and God&#39;s hand meets us. We take one step of faith, and He carries us the rest of the way.

We don&#39;t pull ourselves out of the grave. We can&#39;t. We&#39;re dead in it.

But when we trust—when we simply turn toward the water and step—God&#39;s hand reaches down and lifts us out.

Paul captures this in Ephesians 2:4-5:

<blockquote>
&quot;But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you have been saved.&quot;

— Ephesians 2:4-5
</blockquote>

Made us alive. Not &quot;helped us get a little better.&quot; Not &quot;gave us a boost.&quot; Made us alive.

That&#39;s resurrection language. That&#39;s dead-to-life language. That&#39;s grace language.

You can&#39;t resurrect yourself. You can only be resurrected. And that&#39;s what God does when you step toward the water. He doesn&#39;t just wash you. He raises you.

From death to life. From grave to grace. From wretch to beloved.

<strong>6. Addressing Objections: Cheap Grace vs. Costly Grace</strong>

Whenever we talk about grace being free, unearned, and given to the undeserving, someone will object: &quot;But doesn&#39;t that make grace cheap? Doesn&#39;t that give people license to sin?&quot;

Dietrich Bonhoeffer addressed this in his book <em>The Cost of Discipleship</em>. He distinguished between cheap grace and costly grace.

Cheap grace is grace without discipleship. Grace without transformation. Grace that says, &quot;You&#39;re forgiven, so keep living however you want.&quot; It&#39;s grace as a Get Out of Jail Free card that you pocket and then go back to your old life.

Costly grace is grace that costs God everything—the life of His Son on the cross—and costs us everything too. Not to earn it, but as a response to it. When you truly encounter grace, it doesn&#39;t leave you unchanged. It transforms you.

Bonhoeffer writes:

<blockquote>
&quot;Cheap grace is the preaching of forgiveness without requiring repentance, baptism without church discipline, Communion without confession, absolution without personal confession. Cheap grace is grace without discipleship, grace without the cross, grace without Jesus Christ, living and incarnate. Costly grace is the treasure hidden in the field; for the sake of it a man will gladly go and sell all that he has.&quot;

— Dietrich Bonhoeffer, <em>The Cost of Discipleship</em>
</blockquote>

The grace we encounter at the water&#39;s edge is costly—not in what we pay to receive it, but in what it cost Christ to offer it, and in how completely it transforms us when we truly receive it.

Costly grace says: &quot;You&#39;re forgiven, and because of that, you&#39;re free to become who you were always meant to be. Not by striving, but by surrendering. Not by performing, but by receiving and then living out of the abundance of what you&#39;ve received.&quot;

The grace extended at the water&#39;s edge is costly grace. It cost Jesus His life. And it will cost us our old life—the one built on autonomy and self-rule. But what we gain in exchange is life itself. Real life. Abundant life. Eternal life.

<h2>Biblical Parallels</h2>

<strong>Jonah: Running from God, Saved by Grace (Jonah 1-2)</strong>

We&#39;ve touched on Jonah already, but his story deserves deeper exploration because it&#39;s the perfect picture of grace pursuing the rebellious.

Jonah receives God&#39;s call: go to Nineveh. He boards a ship going the opposite direction. A storm arises. Jonah knows it&#39;s because of him. He tells the sailors to throw him overboard.

And here&#39;s where it gets interesting: Jonah expects to die. He&#39;s running from God, and he&#39;d rather die than obey. But God doesn&#39;t let him die.

Instead, God provides a fish to swallow him. And inside that fish, in the belly of darkness, Jonah prays:

<blockquote>
&quot;In my distress I called to the LORD, and he answered me. From the depths of the grave I called for help, and you listened to my cry.&quot;

— Jonah 2:2
</blockquote>

From the grave. That&#39;s where Jonah is. Spiritually, emotionally, physically—he&#39;s in the grave. And from there, he cries out. And God answers.

God doesn&#39;t lecture Jonah. Doesn&#39;t shame him. Doesn&#39;t say, &quot;You should have listened the first time.&quot; God simply rescues him. The fish vomits Jonah onto dry land, and God&#39;s call comes again: &quot;Go to Nineveh.&quot;

This is amazing grace. Grace that pursues the runner. Grace that rescues the rebel. Grace that gives second chances—and third, and fourth, and hundredth.

<strong>The Prodigal Son: From the Pigpen to the Father&#39;s Embrace (Luke 15:11-32)</strong>

The younger son demands his inheritance early (essentially wishing his father dead), leaves home, squanders everything in wild living, and ends up in a pigpen, so desperate he&#39;s eating pig food.

From that pigpen, he makes a decision: &quot;I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants&quot; (Luke 15:18-19).

He&#39;s not expecting grace. He&#39;s expecting to be a servant at best. He&#39;s rehearsing his speech, his apology, his offer to earn his way back.

But watch what happens:

<blockquote>
&quot;But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him.&quot;

— Luke 15:20
</blockquote>

The father doesn&#39;t wait for the apology. Doesn&#39;t wait for the son to grovel. While the son is still far off, the father runs.

And when the son tries to give his speech, the father cuts him off. He calls for the best robe, a ring, sandals. He throws a party.

This is scandalous grace. The son deserves nothing. He&#39;s squandered everything. He&#39;s come home smelling like pigs. But the father doesn&#39;t care about what he deserves. The father cares about who he is: his son.

Grace isn&#39;t based on worthiness. It&#39;s based on relationship. And in God&#39;s economy, you&#39;re a son or daughter not because you&#39;ve earned it but because He&#39;s declared it.

<strong>The Woman Caught in Adultery: No Condemnation (John 8:1-11)</strong>

The religious leaders drag a woman caught in adultery before Jesus. The Law says she should be stoned. They&#39;re testing Jesus, trying to trap Him.

Jesus bends down and writes in the dust. Then He says: &quot;Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her&quot; (John 8:7).

One by one, the accusers leave. Starting with the oldest—the ones who&#39;ve lived long enough to know their own sin.

Finally, it&#39;s just Jesus and the woman. And Jesus asks:

<blockquote>
&quot;Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?&quot; &quot;No one, sir,&quot; she said. &quot;Then neither do I condemn you,&quot; Jesus declared. &quot;Go now and leave your life of sin.&quot;

— John 8:10-11
</blockquote>

No condemnation. Not &quot;You&#39;re forgiven because you promised never to do it again.&quot; Not &quot;You&#39;re forgiven because you&#39;ve suffered enough.&quot; Just: &quot;Neither do I condemn you.&quot;

That&#39;s grace. Unearned. Undeserved. Freely given.

And notice what follows: &quot;Go now and leave your life of sin.&quot; Grace doesn&#39;t excuse sin—it empowers transformation. It doesn&#39;t say, &quot;Keep living however you want.&quot; It says, &quot;You&#39;re free now. Free from condemnation. Free from the power of sin. So go live like the free person you are.&quot;

<strong>Zacchaeus: Grace That Seeks the Seeker (Luke 19:1-10)</strong>

Zacchaeus is a chief tax collector—a collaborator with Rome, a thief who&#39;s grown rich by extorting his own people. He&#39;s hated. Despised. Excluded.

But he&#39;s curious about Jesus. So he climbs a tree to see Him.

Jesus stops under the tree, looks up, and says: &quot;Zacchaeus, come down immediately. I must stay at your house today&quot; (Luke 19:5).

The crowd grumbles: &quot;He has gone to be the guest of a sinner.&quot;

But Zacchaeus responds to grace with transformation: &quot;Look, Lord! Here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount&quot; (Luke 19:8).

Jesus didn&#39;t demand restitution first. He offered relationship first. And the relationship produced transformation.

That&#39;s how grace works. It doesn&#39;t wait for us to fix ourselves. It meets us where we are, offers relationship, and then—out of that relationship—transformation flows.

John Ortberg captures this perfectly:

<blockquote>
&quot;Grace is the offer of God&#39;s ceaseless presence and irrational love. The only thing you have to do is to want to be with Jesus more than you want anything else.&quot;

— John Ortberg, <em>The Me I Want to Be</em>
</blockquote>

Zacchaeus wanted to see Jesus more than he wanted to maintain his reputation. He climbed a tree—ridiculous for a wealthy tax collector. And Jesus saw him, called him down, and offered relationship. That&#39;s grace—meeting us in our ridiculous, desperate seeking and saying, &quot;Come down. I want to be with you.&quot;

<h2>Theological Anchor</h2>

<blockquote>
&quot;For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast.&quot;

— Ephesians 2:8-9
</blockquote>

Let&#39;s unpack this verse phrase by phrase, because it&#39;s the theological bedrock of everything we&#39;re exploring.

<strong>&quot;By grace you have been saved&quot;:</strong>

Grace is the means. Not effort. Not goodness. Not trying really hard. Grace.

And notice the tense: &quot;have been saved.&quot; It&#39;s done. Accomplished. Complete. You&#39;re not trying to get saved. If you&#39;re in Christ, you are saved. Present reality, not future hope.

<strong>&quot;Through faith&quot;:</strong>

Faith is the instrument. The way grace is received. Not works, but trust. Belief. Reliance on God&#39;s promise rather than your own ability.

Faith isn&#39;t the same as perfection. You don&#39;t have to have perfect faith to be saved. You just have to have faith—even mustard-seed-sized faith—in a perfect Savior.

<strong>&quot;And this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God&quot;:</strong>

This is crucial. Both the salvation and the faith are gifts. You can&#39;t even take credit for believing. God gives the grace. God gives the faith. You receive.

Why does Paul emphasize this? Because our default mode is to try to contribute something. To earn a little bit. To prove we&#39;re worthy. But grace, by definition, can&#39;t be earned. The moment you think you&#39;ve contributed to your salvation, you&#39;ve moved from grace to works. And works can&#39;t save.

<strong>&quot;Not by works, so that no one can boast&quot;:</strong>

If salvation were by works, then the people who did the most works would have bragging rights. They&#39;d be &quot;better Christians&quot; than those who did fewer works.

But in grace, there&#39;s no hierarchy. The apostle Paul and the thief on the cross stand before God on the same footing: utterly dependent on grace.

No one can boast. Not about how good they are. Not about how hard they tried. Not about how much they&#39;ve done for God.

We can only boast in this: Amazing grace, how sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me.

Andrew Murray beautifully expresses this:

<blockquote>
&quot;The first link between my soul and Christ is not my goodness but my badness, not my merit but my misery, not my standing but my falling, not my riches but my need.&quot;

— Andrew Murray, <em>Abide in Christ</em>
</blockquote>

We don&#39;t come to grace because we&#39;re good enough. We come because we&#39;re desperate enough. And that desperation—that acknowledgment of our wretchedness—is the beginning of transformation.

<hr>

<h2>The Wayfarer Moment</h2>

<strong>When grace stops being doctrine and becomes your story.</strong>

You can know the theology of grace—memorize Ephesians 2:8-9, understand justification by faith, articulate the difference between cheap and costly grace—and still not experience grace.

<blockquote>
&quot;For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast.&quot;

— Ephesians 2:8-9
</blockquote>

Because grace isn&#39;t just a doctrine. It&#39;s an encounter.

The wayfarer moment is when you stop understanding grace in the abstract and start experiencing it in the specific. When it&#39;s not just &quot;God loves the world&quot; but &quot;God loves me.&quot; Not just &quot;Jesus died for sinners&quot; but &quot;Jesus died for me.&quot;

This is what happened in the story from the blog. The writer wasn&#39;t learning about grace for the first time. They&#39;d grown up in a Christian home, been taught the faith, knew the path they should follow.

But they&#39;d trampled on that gift. Traded it for autonomy. Ruled from their own throne. And ended up in a grave of their own making.

The wayfarer moment came when they stood at the dead end of their self-made path and heard the whisper: &quot;Turn around. The water is here. Just trust Me.&quot;

And they did. One step. Then another. And with each step, they felt God&#39;s hand lifting them out of the grave.

That&#39;s when grace stopped being a hymn they sang and became their testimony.

<em>I once was lost but now I&#39;m found. Was blind but now I see.</em>

Not theological theory. Personal history.

<h2>Original Writing from the Blog</h2>

Amazing Grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
But I trampled on that gift of life
Refusing to be set free

I traded it in for my version of freedom
Ruling others from my own throne
Instead of following the Master&#39;s plan
I wrote one of my own

I failed to see that it was a lie
A folly from the master of deceit
I thought I invented it on my own
How the system I would cheat

I learned the art of hiding out
And dodging from my own shame
Never taking responsibility
Everyone else was to blame

But in the end I was the fool
For freedom I did not understand
Freedom is not free you see
It didn&#39;t work out how I planned

The freedom I was living
Turned out to make me a slave
Rather than bringing life to me
It buried me in my own grave

He led me down a dead end path
So He could show me His vision
It stopped way short of the water of life
And I had to make a decision

Would I turn around and walk away
Fleeing from the water&#39;s edge
Or would I leave my road and run to Him
Embracing His freedom pledge

I stepped off that dead end road
And simply trusted He would save
With each step I took, I felt His hand
Lifting me out of my grave

Amazing Grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I&#39;m found
Was blind but now I see

<h2>Song Integration</h2>

This writing came out of a time when I&#39;d been living what I thought was freedom—making my own choices, ruling my own life, writing my own plan. I&#39;d grown up knowing the truth, but I&#39;d convinced myself I could improve on it. Make it work better for me.

The lie was subtle: &quot;You don&#39;t have to rebel completely. Just tweak the plan a little. Take what works, leave what doesn&#39;t. You&#39;re smart enough to figure this out.&quot;

But autonomy is a dead-end road. It doesn&#39;t look like a dead end at first. It looks like freedom, like possibility, like the open road. But eventually, it stops. It hits a wall. And you realize you&#39;re standing in a grave of your own making.

For me, that moment came when I couldn&#39;t hide anymore. When the consequences of my choices caught up with me. When the shame I&#39;d been dodging finally cornered me and I had to face the truth: I&#39;d trampled on grace. I&#39;d taken the gift of life and thrown it away for a counterfeit.

I expected condemnation. I deserved it. If there&#39;s a line between &quot;forgivable&quot; and &quot;too far gone,&quot; I was sure I&#39;d crossed it.

But standing at that dead end, I heard the invitation: Turn around. The water is here.

I looked back over my shoulder and saw it. The water&#39;s edge. Living water. Clean, clear, flowing. And Jesus standing there, arms open, saying: &quot;Come. Just trust Me. I&#39;ll lift you out.&quot;

I didn&#39;t deserve it. But grace isn&#39;t about what I deserve. It&#39;s about who He is.

So I stepped off the dead-end road. One step. Then another. And with each step, I felt His hand. Lifting me. Carrying me. Raising me from the grave I&#39;d dug.

The old hymn became my testimony: <em>I once was lost but now I&#39;m found. Was blind but now I see.</em>

This writing is my re-telling of that hymn. My personal declaration of what grace did for me when I was too far gone to save myself.

<h3>Song: &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;</h3>

<h2>Reflections for the Road</h2>

These questions aren&#39;t homework. They&#39;re invitations to encounter grace personally.

<strong>Questions for the Journey:</strong>

<ol>
<li><strong>Where are you trading true freedom for false freedom?</strong>

What self-made throne are you sitting on? Where are you trying to write your own plan instead of following God&#39;s? Be specific. Name it. Because you can&#39;t step off a path you won&#39;t admit you&#39;re on.
</li>
<li><strong>What dead-end road has God let you travel to show you His vision?</strong>

Sometimes God lets us exhaust our own options before He reveals His. Not to punish us, but to prepare us to receive what He&#39;s offering. Where has your path dead-ended? And what is God showing you from that vantage point?
</li>
<li><strong>What&#39;s keeping you from stepping toward the water&#39;s edge?</strong>

Is it shame? The belief that you&#39;ve gone too far? The fear that grace has limits and you&#39;ve exceeded them? Name the obstacle. Bring it into the light. Because shame loses its power when it&#39;s spoken aloud.
</li>
<li><strong>Read Luke 15:11-32 slowly. Put yourself in the prodigal&#39;s place. What would it feel like to have the Father run toward you?</strong>

Don&#39;t rush this. Imagine standing far off, still in your filth, rehearsing your apology. And then imagine seeing the Father—not waiting sternly at the door, but running toward you with arms open. What would that do to your heart?
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Practice: Writing Your Grace Story</h2>

Grace becomes real when it becomes personal. When it&#39;s not just doctrine but story.

Take some time—unhurried time—and write your own grace story. Not a theological essay. A story.

Answer these prompts:

<ul>
<li>Where was I when grace found me?</li>
<li>What dead-end road had I traveled?</li>
<li>What did I think about myself? About God? About my worthiness to be loved?</li>
<li>When did I hear the invitation to turn toward the water&#39;s edge?</li>
<li>What did stepping toward grace feel like?</li>
<li>How has grace lifted me from my grave?</li>
</ul>

Don&#39;t worry about making it sound polished or spiritual. Write it honestly. Write it in your own voice. Write it as your testimony.

And then, if possible, share it with someone. Not to impress them. Just to declare it. To say out loud: This is what grace did for me.

Because when grace stops being doctrine and becomes your story, it changes everything.

<hr>

<h2>Closing Image</h2>

You&#39;re standing in the water now. Not all the way in yet—just ankle-deep. But you&#39;re in.

And the water is exactly what was promised. Living. Flowing. Clean.

The mud from the swamp is starting to wash away. Not all at once, but gradually. With each step deeper, more of it lifts off and is carried downstream.

You look down at your feet and you can see them clearly for the first time in years. The water is so clear you can see straight to the bottom. And you realize: This is what I&#39;ve been longing for. Not just to be clean, but to be seen—truly seen—and loved anyway.

You cup water in your hands and pour it over your arms. The mud runs off in brown streams. Underneath: skin. Your actual skin. You&#39;d almost forgotten what it looked like.

You&#39;re still a mess. You&#39;re still covered in swamp residue. But you&#39;re also being washed. Both are true at the same time.

And from somewhere deep inside—deeper than the shame, deeper than the fear, deeper than the old lies—you hear it rising up. Your voice. Singing.

<em>Amazing grace, how sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me. I once was lost but now I&#39;m found, was blind but now I see.</em>

It&#39;s not just a hymn anymore. It&#39;s your story.

You&#39;re at the water&#39;s edge. You&#39;ve stepped in. And grace is washing you clean.

One step at a time. One breath at a time. One grace-filled moment at a time.

You&#39;re being made new. And it&#39;s only just beginning.

<strong>An Invitation to Rest</strong>

You&#39;ve walked through eight chapters now. You&#39;ve named the swamp, cried out for help, made a decision, let something die, stepped into living water, found shelter in grace&#39;s shadow, received what you don&#39;t deserve, and dug deep to let healing reach the wounds.

You&#39;ve experienced dramatic grace. Life-changing encounters. Rescue. Cleansing. Healing.

<strong>Are you exhausted from trying to maintain the intensity?</strong>

Because here&#39;s what happens after the crisis: We try to keep the fire burning through sheer effort and willpower. We pray longer. Read more. Volunteer for everything. We assume that sustaining grace requires the same intensity as receiving it.

And we almost crash again. Different swamp, same drowning.

Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve discovered: <strong>Grace isn&#39;t meant to be lived in constant crisis mode.</strong>

The swamp taught you honesty. The water&#39;s edge taught you grace. But now? Now you&#39;re learning something that might feel revolutionary—or maybe even scandalous:

<strong>You don&#39;t have to keep performing. You can rest. Even while you&#39;re working.</strong>

It&#39;s about discovering that grace offers rhythm—a sustainable way of walking with God that actually fits with how you&#39;re made. Not manufactured intensity. Not constant peak experiences. Not exhausting striving.

<em>Unforced rhythms.</em>

But here&#39;s the challenge: If you&#39;ve been living in frenzy for years—and most of us have—rhythm will feel foreign at first. Maybe even wrong. The guilt will whisper, &quot;Shouldn&#39;t I be doing more?&quot; The fear will ask, &quot;What if I fall behind?&quot; The comparison will accuse, &quot;Everyone else seems busier. Am I being lazy?&quot;

So before you continue, pause. Consider:

<em>Can you say, even tentatively: &quot;God, I&#39;m tired of running. I&#39;m willing to learn a different pace. I&#39;m willing to believe that You delight in me when I&#39;m resting as much as when I&#39;m working. Teach me Your unforced rhythms.&quot;</em>

That&#39;s enough. That willingness opens the door.

Because what comes next isn&#39;t about doing more—it&#39;s about living from a different place. Not striving toward fullness, but living from fullness. Not working for rest, but working from rest.

Welcome to the unforced rhythms of grace.

<hr>

Let&#39;s be honest about what rhythm actually feels like. Because if you&#39;ve been living in frenzy for years—and most of us have—rhythm will feel foreign at first. Maybe even wrong.

Rhythm feels like:

<ul>
<li><strong>Breath:</strong> Deep, full, unforced. You&#39;re not gasping anymore. You&#39;re breathing.</li>
<li><strong>Pace:</strong> You&#39;re walking, not sprinting. And you&#39;re not collapsing from exhaustion at the end of the day.</li>
<li><strong>Space:</strong> There&#39;s margin in your calendar. Silence in your schedule. Room to breathe.</li>
<li><strong>Presence:</strong> You&#39;re actually here. Not mentally rehearsing the next thing or replaying the last thing. Here.</li>
<li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> You&#39;ve stopped juggling seventeen balls and picked up the three that actually matter.</li>
</ul>

But here&#39;s what rhythm might also feel like, at least at first:

<ul>
<li><strong>Guilt:</strong> &quot;Shouldn&#39;t I be doing more?&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Fear:</strong> &quot;What if I fall behind?&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Comparison:</strong> &quot;Everyone else seems busier. Am I being lazy?&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Disorientation:</strong> &quot;I don&#39;t know how to just be. I only know how to do.&quot;</li>
</ul>

This is normal. Because rhythm challenges everything our culture teaches us about productivity, worth, and significance.

Our culture says: More is better. Busy is virtuous. Rest is weakness. Your value is measured by your output.

Grace says: Enough is enough. Sustainable is sustainable. Rest is sacred. Your value was settled at the cross.

<blockquote>
&quot;The great danger facing all of us is not that we shall make an absolute failure of life, nor that we shall fall into outright viciousness, nor that we shall be terribly unhappy... The danger is that we may fail to perceive life, and fall into a working routine and a sleeping routine.&quot;
— Dallas Willard, <em>The Spirit of the Disciplines</em>
</blockquote>

Rhythm requires unlearning. It requires deprogramming years of messages that tied your worth to your productivity. It requires believing something scandalous: God delights in you when you&#39;re resting as much as when you&#39;re working.

Maybe more.

<h2>Key Themes</h2>

<h3>1. From Hype to Home: The Set Point Theory</h3>

There&#39;s a concept in psychology called the &quot;set point&quot; theory of happiness. It suggests that each of us has a baseline level of well-being—a natural temperament that&#39;s relatively stable over time. Good things happen, bad things happen, but we tend to return to our set point.

Here&#39;s why this matters for understanding grace: Grace doesn&#39;t promise constant emotional highs. It doesn&#39;t promise that every day will feel like a mountaintop experience.

Grace offers something better: a stable foundation beneath the fluctuations.

Not hype, but home.
Not peak experiences, but sustainable presence.
Not manufactured intensity, but authentic rhythm.

Think about it: You can have a hard day and still be grounded in grace. You can feel sad and still be held by God. You can experience disappointment, frustration, even anger—and still be living in the unforced rhythms of grace.

Because grace isn&#39;t about eliminating life&#39;s natural ups and downs. It&#39;s about providing the steady baseline—the set point—from which you experience them.

I spent years chasing the high. The worship experience that gave me goosebumps. The prayer time where I felt God&#39;s presence palpably. The Bible study where everything clicked and I was convinced I&#39;d finally &quot;got it.&quot;

And then I&#39;d crash. The goosebumps would fade. The presence would feel distant. The clarity would blur. And I&#39;d think, &quot;I&#39;m losing it. I&#39;m backsliding. I need to try harder.&quot;

So I&#39;d manufacture the intensity. Force the experience. Push for the feeling.

Until I discovered: Grace isn&#39;t the high. Grace is the home. The stable foundation. The set point.

Some days are up. Some days are down. But underneath it all, there&#39;s grace. Steady. Reliable. New every morning.

Henri Nouwen captures this beautifully:

<blockquote>
&quot;The greatest gift of the spiritual life is to be able to rest in God&#39;s presence.&quot;
— Henri Nouwen, <em>The Return of the Prodigal Son</em>
</blockquote>

Not to perform in God&#39;s presence. Not to achieve in God&#39;s presence. To rest. This is the home we&#39;re invited into—a place of abiding rest beneath all the fluctuations.

<h3>2. Daily Bread, Daily Grace: The Manna Experience</h3>

When Israel wandered in the wilderness, God provided manna—bread from heaven—every single morning. But there were rules: gather only what you need for today. Don&#39;t try to hoard it for tomorrow. Trust that tomorrow will have its own provision.

When Israel first saw it, they said &quot;Man hu?&quot;—&quot;What is it?&quot; The question mark. They didn&#39;t recognize God&#39;s provision because it didn&#39;t look like what they expected.

But day after day, as they gathered it and ate it and were sustained by it, the question mark changed to an exclamation mark. &quot;This is God&#39;s provision! This is grace made tangible!&quot;

Living in unforced rhythms means participating in a manna experience:

<ul>
<li>You don&#39;t have to figure out next month&#39;s provision today</li>
<li>You just gather today&#39;s manna</li>
<li>You trust tomorrow will have its own</li>
<li>You don&#39;t hoard grace; you receive it fresh each morning</li>
</ul>

This is what Jesus taught His disciples to pray: &quot;Give us this day our daily bread.&quot; Not weekly bread. Not monthly bread. Daily bread.

Because grace is meant to be received in rhythm—morning by morning, day by day.

I&#39;m a planner. I want to have the next three months figured out. I want backup plans for my backup plans. I want to secure tomorrow&#39;s grace today, just in case God doesn&#39;t show up tomorrow.

But that&#39;s not how manna works. That&#39;s not how grace works.

When Israel tried to hoard manna, it rotted. It bred worms. It stank.

When I try to hoard grace—when I try to manufacture tomorrow&#39;s provision today—it does the same thing. It becomes dead religion instead of living relationship. Performance instead of presence. Anxiety instead of trust.

The manna experience teaches me: Today&#39;s grace is sufficient for today. And tomorrow&#39;s grace will come tomorrow.

This is freedom. The freedom to be fully present to today instead of anxiously trying to control tomorrow.

<h3>3. From Survival to Thriving: Asking Different Questions</h3>

There&#39;s a fundamental difference between surviving and thriving. Survival is crisis management. Thriving is intentional cultivation.

In the swamp, survival was the only option. How do I make it through today? How do I keep breathing? How do I not completely fall apart?

At the water&#39;s edge, you moved from crisis to cleansing. Still focused on immediate needs—getting clean, finding healing, experiencing rescue.

But in the unforced rhythms of grace, you&#39;re learning to thrive. You&#39;re not just reacting to crises anymore. You&#39;re building a sustainable life. You&#39;re asking different questions:

<ul>
<li>What do I want to see MORE of in my life?</li>
<li>What do I want to see LESS of?</li>
<li>What do I want NOT AT ALL anymore?</li>
</ul>

From these questions come projects, goals, plans. Not frantic New Year&#39;s resolutions that set you up for failure. But grace-paced renewal that leads to transformation.

MORE: Connection with God. Authentic community. Creative expression. Rest. Joy. Presence.

LESS: Hurry. Performance. People-pleasing. Comparison. Distraction.

NOT AT ALL: Shame. Fear-based motivation. Relationships that drain rather than energize. Commitments that don&#39;t align with my calling.

These aren&#39;t rules. They&#39;re rhythms. Patterns you choose because they bring life.

And here&#39;s the beautiful thing: When you live from these rhythms long enough, they stop feeling like discipline and start feeling like desire. You don&#39;t have to force yourself to rest—you crave it. You don&#39;t have to remind yourself to be present—it becomes natural.

This is the shift from duty to delight. From obligation to overflow. From working toward rest to working from rest.

<strong>Becoming Real Takes Time</strong>

But let&#39;s be honest: this transformation doesn&#39;t happen overnight. The shift from frenzy to rhythm, from performance to presence, from duty to delight—it&#39;s gradual. It requires patience with yourself.

Margery Williams captures this beautifully in <em>The Velveteen Rabbit</em>:

<blockquote>
&quot;It doesn&#39;t happen all at once,&quot; said the Skin Horse. &quot;You become. It takes a long time. That&#39;s why it doesn&#39;t happen often to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don&#39;t matter at all, because once you are Real you can&#39;t be ugly, except to people who don&#39;t understand.&quot;

— Margery Williams, <em>The Velveteen Rabbit</em>
</blockquote>

Becoming Real—learning to live in unforced rhythms—means being loved into authenticity over time. It means:

<ul>
<li>Your rough edges get worn smooth not through self-improvement programs, but through the daily friction of grace</li>
<li>You get &quot;loose in the joints&quot;—less rigid, more flexible, more able to bend without breaking</li>
<li>You become &quot;shabby&quot; by the world&#39;s standards—less polished, less impressive, less concerned with appearances</li>
<li>But you&#39;re Real. Authentic. No longer performing. No longer pretending. Just present.</li>
</ul>

This is what the unforced rhythms are creating in you. Not overnight transformation. Not instant perfection. But steady, gentle, persistent becoming.

You&#39;re being loved into who you actually are. And that takes time. Be patient with yourself.

<h3>4. Jesus&#39; Rhythm: The Model for Sustainability</h3>

If you want to understand unforced rhythms, watch Jesus. He&#39;s the master of sustainable spiritual life. He never burned out. Never collapsed under the weight of ministry. Never lost His connection to the Father.

How?

Rhythm.

Mark 1:35 captures it perfectly:

<blockquote>
&quot;Before daybreak the next morning, Jesus got up and went out to an isolated place to pray.&quot;

— Mark 1:35 (NLT)
</blockquote>

This wasn&#39;t a one-time event. It was His pattern. His rhythm. Withdrawal and engagement. Solitude and community. Prayer and action. Rest and work.

Jesus would pour Himself out in ministry—teaching, healing, casting out demons, engaging with crowds. Then He would withdraw. To a solitary place. To pray. To reconnect with the Father. To be refilled.

He didn&#39;t wait until He was empty. He maintained the rhythm.

Engagement. Withdrawal. Engagement. Withdrawal.

Because He lived in this rhythm, He had something to give. Not out of duty. Not out of obligation. Out of overflow.

This is the model. This is what sustainable looks like.

And notice: Jesus faced immense pressure to skip the rhythm. People were sick. Crowds were waiting. Disciples were asking questions. There was always more to do.

But He protected the rhythm. He withdrew even when others wanted more from Him. He rested even when the need was urgent.

Why? Because He knew: If I don&#39;t maintain the rhythm, I&#39;ll have nothing to give. And giving from empty isn&#39;t sustainable.

I&#39;ve spent most of my Christian life trying to give from empty. Leading worship when I was spiritually depleted. Teaching when I hadn&#39;t spent time with God myself. Serving when I desperately needed rest.

And I wondered why I burned out. Why ministry felt like a burden. Why I was always exhausted.

Jesus shows a different way. Maintain the rhythm. Withdrawal and engagement. Empty and refill. Rest and work. Henri Nouwen, who wrote extensively about this pattern, observed:

<blockquote>
&quot;Without solitude it is virtually impossible to live a spiritual life. Solitude begins with a time and place for God, and him alone.&quot;
— Henri Nouwen, <em>Making All Things New</em>
</blockquote>

Not after you&#39;ve earned it. Not when the work is done. As part of the work.

<h2>The Core Scripture Truth</h2>

<strong>Matthew 11:28-30 (MSG)</strong> - &quot;Are you tired? Worn out? Burned out on religion? Come to me. Get away with me and you&#39;ll recover your life. I&#39;ll show you how to take a real rest. Walk with me and work with me—watch how I do it. Learn the unforced rhythms of grace. I won&#39;t lay anything heavy or ill-fitting on you. Keep company with me and you&#39;ll learn to live freely and lightly.&quot;

This is Jesus&#39; manifesto for sustainable spiritual life, beautifully rendered in Eugene Peterson&#39;s <em>The Message</em>. Let&#39;s unpack it slowly:

<strong>&quot;Are you tired? Worn out? Burned out on religion?&quot;</strong>

Jesus&#39; invitation is not to the strong, the capable, the ones who have it all together. It&#39;s to the exhausted. The burned out. The ones who&#39;ve turned even their faith into exhausting performance.

If you&#39;re tired—not just physically tired, but soul-tired—you&#39;re exactly who Jesus is calling.

<strong>&quot;Come to me. Get away with me and you&#39;ll recover your life.&quot;</strong>

Not &quot;try harder.&quot; Not &quot;do more.&quot; Come. Get away. Recover your life—the life you&#39;ve lost to frenzy, performance, and endless striving.

This is about recovery, not achievement. Restoration, not productivity.

<strong>&quot;I&#39;ll show you how to take a real rest.&quot;</strong>

Real rest. Not the fake rest of distraction or escape. Not the guilty rest where you&#39;re constantly thinking about what you should be doing. Real rest. Soul rest. The kind that actually restores.

<strong>&quot;Walk with me and work with me—watch how I do it.&quot;</strong>

Jesus doesn&#39;t just tell you about rest—He shows you. Watch His rhythms. His pace. His patterns. He withdraws to pray. He rests. He says no. He lives from fullness, not fumes.

<strong>&quot;Learn the unforced rhythms of grace.&quot;</strong>

Here it is—the heart of everything. Unforced rhythms. Not manufactured intensity. Not grinding discipline. Not willpower white-knuckling your way through.

Rhythms—sustainable patterns that fit how you&#39;re made. Unforced—natural, life-giving, flowing from grace rather than grinding against it.

This is what you&#39;re learning to live in. Not crisis mode. Not constant striving. Unforced rhythms of grace.

<strong>&quot;I won&#39;t lay anything heavy or ill-fitting on you.&quot;</strong>

Nothing heavy. Nothing crushing. Nothing that doesn&#39;t fit. Jesus&#39; way of life is custom-made for human beings. It fits. It&#39;s sustainable.

<strong>&quot;Keep company with me and you&#39;ll learn to live freely and lightly.&quot;</strong>

The goal: living freely and lightly. Not weighted down. Not grinding. Not exhausted. Free. Light. Sustainable.

This is the life Jesus offers—and it&#39;s available today, in this moment, through learning His unforced rhythms of grace.

<hr>

<h2>The Wayfarer Moment</h2>

<strong>The shift from frenzy to rhythm doesn&#39;t happen all at once. It happens one choice at a time.</strong>

For years, I lived in frenzy. Crisis mode. Always reacting. Always behind. Always exhausted. I thought that&#39;s what faithfulness looked like—burning out for Jesus.

But frenzy isn&#39;t faithfulness. It&#39;s fear. Fear that if I slow down, I&#39;ll fall behind. Fear that if I rest, I&#39;ll be lazy. Fear that if I&#39;m not producing, I&#39;m not valuable.

The wayfarer moment came when I realized: this isn&#39;t sustainable. I can&#39;t keep living like this. And God doesn&#39;t want me to.

I started protecting time for rest, not as an afterthought when all the work was done, but as a priority woven into my rhythm.

This didn&#39;t happen overnight. It&#39;s still happening. I still slip into frenzy sometimes. I still over-commit. I still try to hoard tomorrow&#39;s grace instead of receiving today&#39;s.

<h2>Song Integration</h2>

I was drowning in activity when I discovered what Eugene Peterson calls &quot;the unforced rhythms of grace.&quot; For years, I&#39;d been living at breakneck speed—calendar packed, to-do list never-ending, mind constantly racing. I wore busyness like a badge of honor, convinced that exhaustion proved devotion. But I was running on fumes, burned out. Then I crashed. Not dramatically—just stopped.

In that crashed season, my counselor asked me a question I couldn&#39;t answer: &quot;When was the last time you noticed God&#39;s presence without trying to do anything with it?&quot; I sat there, silent. Because every spiritual practice had become performance. Every quiet time had an agenda. I&#39;d turned even rest into productivity. He gave me one assignment: &quot;Go for a walk. Don&#39;t pray. Don&#39;t problem-solve. Don&#39;t plan. Just notice.&quot; And then: &quot;Read Matthew 11:28-30 in <em>The Message</em>. Not to study it. Just to hear it.&quot;

<h2>Song Lyrics: (Mindful Bliss of Grace)</h2>

<strong>[Verse 1]</strong>
Ebb and flow, the waves embrace my feet,
Your whispers call where sea and skylines meet.
The setting sun declares the close of day,
Your steadfast love shines bright along the way.

<strong>[Chorus]</strong>
Great is Your faithfulness, steady and true,
Mercies each morning are always brand new.
Through every season, Your love still persists,
You lead me, Lord, into mindful bliss.

<strong>[Verse 2]</strong>
Morning dew reflects Your tender grace,
The sunlight streaks reveal Your holy face.
Each step I take along the sandy trail,
Your voice reminds me, love will never fail.

<strong>[Chorus]</strong>
Great is Your faithfulness, steady and true,
Mercies each morning are always brand new.
Through every season, Your love still persists,
You lead me, Lord, into mindful bliss.

<strong>[Verse 3]</strong>
Starry skies proclaim Your mighty name,
The moon&#39;s soft glow reveals Your love remains.
I lift my heart and cast my cares above,
Your Spirit wraps me in eternal love.

<strong>[Chorus]</strong>
Great is Your faithfulness, steady and true,
Mercies each morning are always brand new.
Through every season, Your love still persists,
You lead me, Lord, into mindful bliss.

<strong>[Bridge]</strong>
Through trials and storms, through winds that roar,
Your steadfast grace remains forevermore.
Each tear I cry, each prayer I raise,
Lifts me higher to endless praise.

<strong>[Verse 4]</strong>
This is my story, this is my song,
Praising my Savior all the day long.
Mercies descending from heaven above,
Filling my heart with Your endless love.

<strong>[Outro]</strong>
Into mindful bliss, I rest in Your grace,
Each moment I live, I behold Your face.
Your mercies endure, Your promises stay,
Forever I&#39;ll walk in Your holy way.

<hr>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;Learn the unforced rhythms of grace.&quot;</strong> You don&#39;t have to maintain crisis-level intensity to stay faithful. Jesus invites you to watch how He does it and learn to live freely and lightly—not forced, not grinding, but flowing with grace.</li>
<li><strong>Receive daily bread, don&#39;t hoard tomorrow&#39;s grace.</strong> Like manna in the wilderness, grace is meant to be gathered fresh each morning. Trust today&#39;s provision and let tomorrow take care of itself.</li>
<li><strong>Work from rest, not toward it.</strong> Sustainable faithfulness means maintaining rhythm—withdrawal and engagement, solitude and community, Sabbath and work—just as Jesus modeled.</li>
<li><strong>&quot;Keep company&quot; with Jesus to recover your life.</strong> Jesus doesn&#39;t just give you instructions for rest—He invites you to walk with Him, work with Him, and watch how He does it. The relationship is the rhythm.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Reflections for the Road</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>Where are you living in frenzy instead of rhythm?</strong>

Look at your calendar. Your commitments. Your daily patterns. Where are you reacting instead of choosing?

Name one specific area where you&#39;re running on adrenaline rather than grace. What would it look like to bring rhythm to that area?
</li>
<li><strong>What does &quot;daily bread&quot; look like for you?</strong>

What are the daily practices that actually sustain you—not the ones you think you should do, but the ones that genuinely nourish you?

Are you gathering today&#39;s manna and trusting tomorrow&#39;s will come? Or are you hoarding, striving, trying to stockpile enough to feel safe?
</li>
<li><strong>Read Matthew 11:28-30 (The Message) slowly.</strong>

&quot;Are you tired? Worn out? Burned out on religion? Come to me. Get away with me and you&#39;ll recover your life. I&#39;ll show you how to take a real rest. Walk with me and work with me—watch how I do it. Learn the unforced rhythms of grace. I won&#39;t lay anything heavy or ill-fitting on you. Keep company with me and you&#39;ll learn to live freely and lightly.&quot;

What does Jesus&#39; invitation to &quot;learn the unforced rhythms of grace&quot; mean for you today? Where are you forcing, grinding, manufacturing what should flow naturally? What would it look like to &quot;keep company&quot; with Jesus and learn to live &quot;freely and lightly&quot;?
</li>
</ol>

<h3>1. Listen to your life</h3>

What brings you life?. What drains you?.

<h3>2. Identify life-giving rhythms</h3>

Based on what you&#39;ve noticed, what rhythms sustain you?. Morning prayer?.

<h3>3. Build them into your life as rhythm, not rules</h3>

The difference: rules say &quot;you have to.&quot; Rhythms say &quot;this is life-giving.&quot; Don&#39;t try to implement everything at once. Pick one or two rhythms this month.

<h3>4. Hold them loosely</h3>

Life changes.. Seasons change..

<h3>5. Review and adjust</h3>

Every few months, review your rhythms.. What&#39;s working?.

<hr>

<h2>Closing Image</h2>

You&#39;re not at the water&#39;s edge anymore. You&#39;ve waded in deeper. And you&#39;ve discovered something surprising: the water has a current.

Not a violent current that sweeps you away. A gentle current. A flow. And when you stop fighting it—when you stop trying to control every movement—you realize the current is carrying you.

This is what the unforced rhythms feel like. You&#39;re not striving anymore. Not forcing. Not manufacturing spiritual experiences or trying to prove your worth through exhausting effort.

<strong>An Invitation to Go Deeper</strong>

You&#39;ve discovered rhythm. You&#39;ve learned the unforced way of living. You&#39;re not in crisis mode anymore, not frantically trying to maintain impossible intensity.

But now I need to ask you something uncomfortable:

<strong>When stress comes, when pressure mounts, when circumstances get hard—do you still revert to old patterns?</strong>

Be honest. Do you still react defensively when criticized? Still withdraw when hurt? Still carry bitterness longer than you should? Still struggle with pride, with comparison, with the need to prove yourself?

Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve discovered: <strong>Rhythms are good. But rhythms without roots become rote. Practices without depth become performance.</strong>

<h2>Key Themes</h2>

<h3>1. The Work of Putting to Death</h3>

Before roots can go deep into what belongs, they have to let go of what doesn&#39;t. This is the paradox at the heart of spiritual growth: deep roots require dying.

There are things that have to be put to death:

<strong>Pride</strong> - The need to be right. The compulsion to prove ourselves. The addiction to being seen, recognized, validated by others.

Pride keeps roots shallow because it keeps us focused on ourselves rather than God. We&#39;re constantly comparing, competing, defending, performing. All that energy goes into image management rather than transformation.

I&#39;ve spent years defending myself. Explaining myself. Making sure people understood my motives. And all that defending kept me shallow. Because I was more concerned with how I looked than with who I was becoming.

Humility is the antidote. Not self-hatred. But what Paul calls &quot;considering others more significant than yourselves&quot; (Philippians 2:3). The freedom to be wrong and still be loved. To lose the argument and not lose yourself.

<strong>Reactivity</strong> - Responding from wounds instead of from identity. When someone criticizes you, do you react defensively? When life doesn&#39;t go your way, do you lash out? When you feel threatened, do you attack?

Reactivity is living from your False Self—the wounded, defended, self-protective version of you.

Deep roots grow when you learn to respond from your True Self—the beloved, secure, grounded-in-God version of you.

There&#39;s a space between what happens to us and how we respond. In that space lies our power to choose. Viktor Frankl called this the essence of human freedom—the ability to choose our response even in the most difficult circumstances.

I&#39;ve been working on this for years, and I still fail regularly. Someone questions my decision, and I immediately get defensive. Someone misunderstands my motives, and I rush to explain. Someone hurts me, and I want to hurt back.

But I&#39;m learning. Learning to pause. To feel the reaction without acting on it. To ask: &quot;Is this coming from my woundedness or from my belovedness?&quot;

That pause—that space between stimulus and response—is where deep roots grow.

<strong>Isolation</strong> - The temptation to withdraw when things get hard. To hide your struggles. To pretend you&#39;re fine when you&#39;re not.

Isolation is the enemy of deep roots. Trees don&#39;t grow in isolation—they grow in groves, forests, communities where their roots intertwine with other roots, creating stability and sharing nutrients.

I&#39;m an introvert. When I&#39;m hurting, my instinct is to withdraw. To pull back. To process alone. And sometimes that&#39;s healthy. But isolation as a lifestyle? That&#39;s deadly.

Deep roots require staying connected even when you want to withdraw. Showing up to community even when you don&#39;t feel like it. Being honest about your struggles even when it&#39;s scary.

<strong>Bitterness</strong> - The nursing of perceived injustices. The rehearsal of how you&#39;ve been wronged. The keeping of records. The refusal to forgive.

Bitterness is like poison in the soil. It doesn&#39;t hurt the person you&#39;re bitter toward—it hurts you. It keeps your roots shallow and twisted, unable to reach the streams of living water because they&#39;re too busy clinging to old wounds.

I&#39;ve carried bitterness. Rehearsed conversations with people who hurt me. Kept score. Built cases. And all that bitterness did was keep me stuck.

Forgiveness is the answer. Not because what happened was okay. But because holding onto it gives it power over you.

You release it so your roots can grow deep into grace rather than staying tangled in grievance.

<blockquote>
&quot;To forgive is to set a prisoner free and discover that the prisoner was you.&quot;
— Lewis B. Smedes, <em>Forgive and Forget</em>
</blockquote>

Putting things to death is only half the work of sending roots deep. The other half is actively cultivating what belongs—replacing what dies with what brings life.

<h3>2. The Work of Cultivating What Belongs</h3>

Putting to death is only half the work. The other half is cultivating what belongs—the virtues, practices, and postures that create conditions for deep roots.

<strong>Humility</strong> - Acknowledging your need for grace. Admitting you don&#39;t have it all together. Embracing your limits rather than pretending they don&#39;t exist.

Humility positions you to receive. Pride keeps you on the surface, performing. Humility sends roots deep, receiving.

<strong>Responsiveness</strong> - Acting from your True Self, not your wounded self. Learning to pause between stimulus and response.

This requires self-awareness—knowing your triggers, understanding your patterns, recognizing when you&#39;re operating from wounds versus operating from belovedness.

And it requires spiritual practices—silence and solitude to hear God&#39;s voice, prayer to seek His guidance, Scripture to renew your mind, community to hold you accountable.

<strong>Connection</strong> - Staying engaged even when vulnerable. Showing up even when it&#39;s hard. Choosing relationship over isolation.

I&#39;ve learned this the hard way: I need people. Not perfect people. Not people who never disappoint me. But people who show up. Who pray for me. Who tell me the truth in love.

Connection is where roots deepen.

<strong>Forgiveness</strong> - Releasing what you can&#39;t control. Letting go of the need for justice, vindication, or revenge.

Forgiveness isn&#39;t a one-time decision. It&#39;s a daily practice. Sometimes an hourly practice. You choose to release the offense again and again until one day you realize it no longer has power over you.

These practices of putting to death and cultivating life create the conditions for deep roots. And Psalm 1 paints the picture of what a deeply rooted life looks like.

<h3>3. The Tree by Streams of Water</h3>

Psalm 1 paints a picture of flourishing that captures everything deep roots make possible:

<blockquote>
&quot;Blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wicked... but whose delight is in the law of the LORD, and who meditates on his law day and night. That person is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither—whatever they do prospers.&quot;

— Psalm 1:1-3
</blockquote>

Notice the progression:

<strong>Planted, not drifting.</strong> Intentional, rooted, stable. You&#39;ve been planted by streams—the water&#39;s edge of grace. Now roots are growing deep.

<strong>Streams of water.</strong> The tree doesn&#39;t generate its own water. It&#39;s positioned by an abundant source. You don&#39;t generate your own grace. You&#39;re rooted in God&#39;s inexhaustible provision.

<strong>Fruit in season.</strong> Not all the time. Not constantly. In season. This is realistic spirituality. There are seasons of growth, seasons of fruit, seasons of dormancy, seasons of pruning. Deep roots don&#39;t guarantee constant productivity. They guarantee sustainable fruitfulness over time.

<strong>Leaf does not wither.</strong> Even in drought—hard seasons when surface moisture evaporates, when emotions are dry, when external supports fail—the deeply rooted tree endures. Why? Because deep roots access water others can&#39;t reach.

<strong>Whatever they do prospers.</strong> Not prosperity gospel. This is organic flourishing. A well-rooted tree naturally prospers because it&#39;s connected to its source.

Stay rooted. The fruit will come. Not forced. Not manufactured. Organic. In season.

This picture of the tree by streams of water is beautiful. But here&#39;s what we need to understand: roots like these don&#39;t grow overnight. They require something most of us struggle with: time.

<h3>4. Roots Take Time</h3>

Here&#39;s what nobody tells you about deep roots: they take time. Years. Sometimes decades.

We live in an instant culture. We want microwavable transformation. Download the app, follow the seven steps, and boom—you&#39;re changed.

But roots don&#39;t work that way.

And for most of that time, you can&#39;t see the growth. Above ground, the tree might look unchanged. But below ground, everything is happening.

This is the hidden work of transformation. The work that happens when no one&#39;s watching. The work that doesn&#39;t make for dramatic testimonies because it&#39;s slow, steady, mostly invisible.

I&#39;m decades into this journey. And I&#39;m still discovering shallow roots. Still finding places where I react instead of respond. Still uncovering bitterness I thought I&#39;d released. Still learning to stay connected when I want to withdraw.

But I&#39;m also seeing growth I couldn&#39;t see five years ago. Situations that would have wrecked me ten years ago now just... don&#39;t. Not because I&#39;m stronger. Because the roots have gone deeper. I&#39;m accessing streams I couldn&#39;t reach before.

This is the long obedience in the same direction. This is the slow work of becoming.

And it&#39;s worth it. Because when the drought comes—and it will come—deep roots mean the difference between withering and thriving.

<blockquote>
&quot;A Christian is never in a state of completion but always in the process of becoming.&quot;
— Martin Luther, <em>Lectures on Romans</em>
</blockquote>

<h2>The Core Scripture Truth</h2>

<strong>John 15:5-8</strong> - &quot;I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing. If you do not remain in me, you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers... This is to my Father&#39;s glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples.&quot;

This is Jesus&#39;s teaching on remaining—on abiding. And it&#39;s the theological foundation for everything this chapter teaches about deep roots.

<strong>&quot;I am the vine; you are the branches.&quot;</strong>

The relationship is organic, not mechanical. Not master and servant. Vine and branches. Living connection. Shared life. The sap that flows through the vine flows through the branches.

You&#39;re not disconnected from Jesus, trying to imitate Him from a distance. You&#39;re connected to Jesus, sharing His life.

<strong>&quot;If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit.&quot;</strong>

The condition is remaining. Not striving. Not performing. Not white-knuckling your way to holiness. Remaining. Abiding. Staying connected.

And the promise is fruit. Not because you&#39;re trying to produce it. But because life is flowing from the vine into the branches. The fruit is inevitable when the connection is sustained.

<strong>&quot;Apart from me you can do nothing.&quot;</strong>

This is both humbling and liberating. Humbling because it reminds you: you&#39;re not the source. You can&#39;t generate spiritual life through your own effort.

Liberating because it takes the pressure off. You don&#39;t have to produce. You just have to remain.

<strong>&quot;This is to my Father&#39;s glory, that you bear much fruit.&quot;</strong>

The goal isn&#39;t your glory. It&#39;s the Father&#39;s. When you bear fruit—when love, joy, peace, patience, kindness grow in you—people see it and give glory to God.

Not because you&#39;re amazing. Because God&#39;s grace is transforming you.

This is the theological anchor: remain in Jesus. Let His words remain in you. And fruit will come—not forced, but organic. Not manufactured, but received. Not through your effort, but through your abiding.

Deep roots make abiding possible. And abiding makes fruit inevitable.

<hr>

<h2>The Wayfarer Moment</h2>

<strong>Learning to trust the hidden work.</strong>

For years, I equated spiritual growth with visible progress. I wanted to see results. Measure outcomes. Track my advancement.

If I couldn&#39;t see it, I questioned whether anything was actually happening.

The most important growth happens underground. Unseen. Unmeasured. Unremarkable to anyone watching.

But God was growing roots.

Through sustained practices. Through showing up even when I didn&#39;t feel like it. Through choosing connection over isolation. Through releasing bitterness and cultivating forgiveness.

Because here&#39;s what I&#39;ve learned: surface-level change happens fast but doesn&#39;t last. Deep transformation happens slowly but endures.

I still have hard days. Days when I&#39;m reactive instead of responsive. Days when I choose isolation over connection. Days when bitterness resurfaces and I have to forgive again.

<hr>

<h2>Psalm 1 (NLT)</h2>

<blockquote>
Oh, the joys of those who do not
    follow the advice of the wicked,
    or stand around with sinners,
    or join in with mockers.
But they delight in the law of the LORD,
    meditating on it day and night.
They are like trees planted along the riverbank,
    bearing fruit each season.
Their leaves never wither,
    and they prosper in all they do.

But not the wicked!
    They are like worthless chaff, scattered by the wind.
They will be condemned at the time of judgment.
    Sinners will have no place among the godly.
For the LORD watches over the path of the godly,
    but the path of the wicked leads to destruction.

— Psalm 1 (NLT)
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2>Song Integration</h2>

The counselor looked at me and said, &quot;You&#39;re doing all the right things, but your roots haven&#39;t gone deep enough yet.&quot;

I didn&#39;t want to hear that. I&#39;d been practicing the rhythms for months. Showing up to prayer even when I didn&#39;t feel like it. Reading Scripture even when it felt dry. Staying connected to community even when I wanted to withdraw.

But he was right. I was doing the practices without allowing them to transform me deeply. I was maintaining spiritual disciplines as performance rather than letting them sink roots that could weather the storms. The rhythms were external, not yet internal. The transformation was happening at the surface level, but the deep roots—the kind that anchor you when everything else shakes—those take time, consistency, and patient trust in the hidden work of God.

&quot;I Will Trust You Lord&quot; emerged from that season of learning to trust the invisible growth happening beneath the surface. The song captures the tension between what we can see (leaves that stay green, fruit that appears) and what we can&#39;t see (roots going deeper, drawing from living water). Like Jeremiah 17:8, this is about trusting the process when you can&#39;t see the progress—believing that God is doing deep work even when all you see is the daily showing up, the ordinary faithfulness, the unglamorous consistency that builds resilience over time.

<hr>

<h2>Song Lyrics: (I Will Trust You Lord)</h2>

<strong>[Verse 1]</strong>
I will trust You, Lord, my shelter, my song
Planted by Your stream, where my roots grow strong
When the heat is near, still my leaves stay bright
In the darkest storm, You will be my light

<strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong>
Oh, my heart is grounded deep in Your grace
Anchored in Your presence, I will stand in faith

<strong>[Chorus]</strong>
Like a tree beside the river, I will stand so tall
Through the fire, through the season, You&#39;re my all in all
My leaves stay green, my soul stays strong
Your love sustains me all life long
I will bear Your fruit, Lord, make me new
I am deeply rooted in You

<strong>[Verse 2]</strong>
I will drink Your Word, let it fill my soul
Day and night I&#39;ll seek You, Lord, You make me whole
When the winds arise, I will not be swayed
For my roots run deep, I will not be afraid

<strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong>
Oh, my heart is grounded deep in Your grace
Anchored in Your presence, I will stand in faith

<strong>[Chorus]</strong>
Like a tree beside the river, I will stand so tall
Through the fire, through the season, You&#39;re my all in all
My leaves stay green, my soul stays strong
Your love sustains me all life long
I will bear Your fruit, Lord, make me new
I am deeply rooted in You

<strong>[Bridge]</strong>
No fear in the drought (No fear, no fear!)
No doubt in the storm (No doubt, no doubt!)
Your love is my anchor (My heart is Yours!)
I&#39;ll trust You, Lord (Forevermore!)

<strong>[Final Chorus]</strong>
Like a tree beside the river, I will stand so tall
Through the fire, through the season, You&#39;re my all in all
My leaves stay green, my soul stays strong
Your love sustains me all life long
I will bear Your fruit, Lord, make me new
I am deeply rooted in You

<strong>[Outro]</strong>
Deeply rooted, never shaken
By Your love, I stand so strong
Deeply rooted, always faithful
In Your hands, I belong

<hr>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Roots determine resilience.</strong> Surface growth impresses, but deep roots sustain. When drought comes, shallow plants wither while deeply rooted trees stay green—not through effort, but through connection to living water.</li>
<li><strong>Put pride, reactivity, isolation, and bitterness to death.</strong> These keep roots shallow. Replace them with humility, responsiveness, connection, and forgiveness to create conditions for deep growth.</li>
<li><strong>Remain in the vine; fruit follows naturally.</strong> You don&#39;t manufacture spiritual fruit through striving. You stay connected to Jesus through sustained practices, and transformation flows from that abiding relationship.</li>
<li><strong>Trust the hidden work.</strong> The most important growth happens underground, unseen and unmeasured. Keep showing up, keep practicing, keep remaining—the roots are going deeper than you realize.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Reflections for the Road</h2>

<strong>Questions for the Journey:</strong>

<ul>
<li>What needs to die so roots can go deep? Where is pride keeping you shallow? Where is reactivity preventing growth? Where is isolation cutting you off? Where is bitterness poisoning the soil?</li>
<li>What practices position you by the stream? Prayer? Scripture? Sabbath? Solitude? Worship? Community? Are you practicing them consistently?</li>
<li>Where are you trying to manufacture fruit instead of remaining in the vine? Are you striving to be more loving? Trying harder to be joyful? White-knuckling your way to peace?</li>
<li>What does &quot;fruit in season&quot; mean for you right now? Not every season is fruitful. Some are for growth. Some for pruning. Some for rest. What season are you in?</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>1. Daily: Drink from the stream</h3>

Choose one practice that connects you to God daily.. Morning prayer and Scripture..

<h3>2. Weekly: Sabbath rest</h3>

Set aside one day (or a few hours) each week for Sabbath.. Not as legalism..

<h3>3. Monthly: Solitude and silence</h3>

Once a month, create extended space for solitude.. A few hours..

<h3>4. Seasonally: Examine your roots</h3>

Every few months, review: Are my roots going deeper?. Or am I staying shallow?.

<h3>5. Community: Grow in groves</h3>

Trees don&#39;t grow in isolation.. Their roots intertwine with other roots..

<hr>

<h2>Closing Image</h2>

You&#39;re standing at the base of an ancient tree. Massive. Towering. Its canopy spreads wide, providing shade for acres.

How long has this tree been here? A hundred years? Two hundred? More?

You walk closer and place your hand on the trunk. Solid. Rough. Weathered by countless storms. Scarred by lightning strikes. Marked by seasons of growth and seasons of pruning.

<strong>An Invitation to See</strong>

You&#39;ve been through ten chapters now. The swamp. The water&#39;s edge. The rhythms. The roots. You&#39;ve experienced rescue, cleansing, healing, and transformation.

But now I need to ask you something that might change how you see everything:

<strong>What if your story isn&#39;t separate from THE story?</strong>

What if the pain you&#39;ve experienced has context? What if the waiting has meaning? What if the struggle isn&#39;t random?

Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve discovered: <strong>Your story—the swamp and the rescue, the breaking and the healing, the death and the rising—follows the same pattern as every redemption story ever told.</strong>

Creation. Fall. Redemption. Restoration.

This isn&#39;t coincidence. It&#39;s the arc of reality itself. The shape of how grace works. The pattern woven into the fabric of existence.

This chapter is about seeing your story within God&#39;s story. And when you do, everything stops being random.

The years in the swamp aren&#39;t just years you lost. They&#39;re the wilderness—like Israel in the desert, like Elijah in the cave, like David on the run. Necessary preparation for what comes next.

The water&#39;s edge isn&#39;t just a nice metaphor. It&#39;s baptism. It&#39;s Red Sea crossing. It&#39;s Jordan River moment. The place where the old dies and the new begins.

The unforced rhythms aren&#39;t just helpful life hacks. They&#39;re manna in the wilderness. They&#39;re Sabbath rest. They&#39;re the sustainable pace of people learning to walk with God.

The deep roots aren&#39;t just personal growth. They&#39;re becoming the tree of Psalm 1, the vine of John 15, the planting of the Lord for His glory.

When you see your story within God&#39;s story, you start to live differently. With purpose. With hope. With perseverance. With mission.

So before you continue, pause. Consider:

<em>Can you say, even tentatively: &quot;God, my story is part of Your story. The broken chapters, the painful seasons, the years I thought were wasted—they&#39;re all woven into the redemption arc You&#39;re writing. Help me see my life through that lens.&quot;</em>

That shift in perspective changes everything.

Because what comes next isn&#39;t just about understanding theology. It&#39;s about seeing your life—all of it—as part of the greatest story ever told.

<h2>Key Themes</h2>

<h3>1. The Gospel as THE Story</h3>

Christianity isn&#39;t one religious option among many. It&#39;s THE story—the framework within which human history unfolds. The lens through which we understand who we are, why we&#39;re here, what went wrong, and how it&#39;s being made right.

The redemption story has a clear arc:

<strong>Creation</strong> - God makes everything good. Humanity is created in His image, designed for relationship with Him, given purpose and dignity and calling. Before any of us sinned, before any of us fell, we had worth because we were created by God, for God, to reflect God.

<strong>Fall</strong> - Sin enters through human rebellion. The image is marred. Relationship is broken. Creation is cursed. Death enters the world. Humanity is exiled from Eden. This is the swamp—not just your personal swamp, but the cosmic swamp we&#39;re all born into.

<strong>Redemption</strong> - God doesn&#39;t abandon His creation. He promises a Savior. He calls a people. He gives the Law to reveal sin and point to grace. He sends prophets to declare His faithfulness. And then—in the fullness of time—He sends His Son. Jesus, the eternal Word, becomes flesh. Lives the perfect life we couldn&#39;t live. Dies the death we deserved. Rises victorious over sin and death. Accomplishes redemption.

<strong>Restoration</strong> - The story isn&#39;t finished. Jesus ascended but promised to return. He&#39;s building His Church. He&#39;s reconciling all things to Himself. And one day—the day we&#39;re waiting for—He will return to judge the living and the dead, to make all things new, to restore creation to what it was always meant to be.

This is THE story. And you&#39;re in it. As Timothy Keller puts it:

<blockquote>
&quot;The Christian story is that God descended into our mess, took the full brunt of our sin and death, and triumphed over it in Jesus.&quot;
— Timothy Keller, <em>The Reason for God</em>
</blockquote>

Not a story of humanity climbing up to God, but God descending to us. Not self-help, but divine rescue. Not moral improvement, but death and resurrection.

<h3>2. Your Story Within God&#39;s Story</h3>

Your personal narrative isn&#39;t separate from God&#39;s narrative. It&#39;s woven into it. Your redemption story is a particular expression of THE redemption story.

When you were in the swamp, you weren&#39;t just struggling with personal sin. You were experiencing the effects of the fall—the brokenness that entered creation when humanity rebelled against God.

When you cried out for help, you weren&#39;t just praying for relief. You were participating in the pattern of human cry and divine response that runs throughout Scripture.

When you encountered grace at the water&#39;s edge, you weren&#39;t just having a personal religious experience. You were meeting the same God who appeared to Moses in the burning bush, who led Israel through the Red Sea, who sent His Son to seek and save the lost.

When you died to self and rose in new life, you weren&#39;t just turning over a new leaf. You were participating in the death and resurrection of Jesus. United with Him in His death. Raised with Him in His resurrection. A new creation.

Your story matters because it&#39;s part of God&#39;s story. The specifics are yours—your swamp is different from mine, your water&#39;s edge encounter is unique, your rhythms and roots look different than anyone else&#39;s. But the pattern is universal. The arc is the same.

Michael Card reminds us:

<blockquote>
&quot;We are not the hero of our own story. We live, instead, in God&#39;s story.&quot;
— Michael Card, <em>A Sacred Sorrow</em>
</blockquote>

This shift in perspective changes everything. I&#39;m not the protagonist trying to write my own happy ending. I&#39;m a character in a much larger narrative—one written by an Author who knows how to redeem every broken chapter.

<h3>3. Nothing Wasted</h3>

One of the most powerful promises in the redemption story is this: nothing is wasted.

Romans 8:28: &quot;And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.&quot;

Notice: Paul doesn&#39;t say all things are good. They&#39;re not. Sin is evil. Suffering is real. Brokenness hurts.

But he does say God works in all things for good. He&#39;s taking even the broken pieces—especially the broken pieces—and weaving them into a story of redemption.

Joseph&#39;s story is the perfect illustration. Betrayed by his brothers. Sold into slavery. Falsely accused. Imprisoned. Forgotten.

But God was at work the whole time. And when Joseph finally sees the bigger story, he can say to his brothers: &quot;You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives&quot; (Genesis 50:20).

You intended harm. God intended good.

Not that God caused the harm. But that He redeemed it. He took what was meant for destruction and turned it into salvation.

This is the promise for you: the years you spent in the swamp aren&#39;t wasted. God is redeeming them. The pain you experienced isn&#39;t meaningless. God is using it. The struggles that nearly broke you are being transformed into testimonies that will strengthen others.

Christine Caine writes:

<blockquote>
&quot;Nothing is wasted in the economy of God. Not a tear, not a heartbreak, not a disappointment.&quot;

— Christine Caine, <em>Undaunted</em>
</blockquote>

This isn&#39;t wishful thinking—it&#39;s the pattern we see throughout Scripture. Every loss, every wound, every seemingly meaningless season becomes raw material for God&#39;s redemptive work.

<h3>4. Living as Part of the Larger Story</h3>

When you grasp that your story is part of God&#39;s story, it changes how you live.

<strong>You live with purpose.</strong> Your life isn&#39;t random. You&#39;re part of God&#39;s redemption project. Every choice matters. Every day has meaning. You&#39;re being formed for eternity.

<strong>You live with hope.</strong> No matter how hard today is, you know the ending. The story doesn&#39;t end with suffering. It ends with restoration. Jesus returns. All things are made new. You live in light of that promised future.

<strong>You live with perseverance.</strong> The struggles you face aren&#39;t meaningless. They&#39;re part of the redemption arc. God is using them to shape you, refine you, prepare you for the role you&#39;ll play in His kingdom.

<strong>You live with mission.</strong> You&#39;re not just receiving redemption. You&#39;re participating in it. God redeems you so you can be part of His redemptive work in the world. You bring light into dark places. Hope into despair. Grace into brokenness.

<strong>You live with gratitude.</strong> When you see the whole arc—creation, fall, redemption, restoration, consummation—you&#39;re overwhelmed by grace. You didn&#39;t earn this. You didn&#39;t deserve it. But God, in His great love, wrote you into His story. Philip Yancey captures the radical nature of grace:

<blockquote>
&quot;Grace, like water, flows to the lowest part. Grace is given to the ones who admit they are thirsty, the ones who admit they cannot save themselves.&quot;

— Philip Yancey, <em>What&#39;s So Amazing About Grace?</em>
</blockquote>

Grace doesn&#39;t wait for us to climb up to it. It flows down to where we actually are—in the low places, the broken places, the places where we&#39;ve finally stopped pretending we can save ourselves.

<h2>The Core Scripture Truth</h2>

<strong>Romans 8:28-30</strong> - &quot;And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son... And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified.&quot;

This is the redemption arc applied to individual lives. Let&#39;s unpack it:

<strong>&quot;In all things God works for the good&quot;</strong>

Not some things. All things. Not just the good experiences. All experiences. God is at work in the swamp and at the water&#39;s edge, in the dying and in the rising, in the valleys and on the mountains.

This doesn&#39;t mean all things are good. They&#39;re not. Sin is evil. Suffering is real. Brokenness hurts.

But it does mean God is working in all things. Taking even the broken pieces and weaving them into a story of redemption.

<strong>&quot;For the good of those who love him&quot;</strong>

The promise is conditional. It&#39;s for those who love God—who are in relationship with Him, who trust Him, who have responded to His call.

If you&#39;ve entered the redemption story—if you&#39;ve responded to God&#39;s call, trusted in Jesus, been brought into the family—then this promise is yours.

God is working all things for your good. Not for your comfort. Not for your ease. But for your ultimate good—conformity to Christ, participation in His kingdom, eternal glory with Him.

<strong>&quot;Called... justified... glorified&quot;</strong>

Paul traces the redemption arc in three movements:

<strong>Called</strong> - God pursued you. Spoke to you. Drew you to Himself. Your &quot;yes&quot; wasn&#39;t the beginning—God&#39;s call was.

<strong>Justified</strong> - You were declared righteous. Not because you earned it. But because Jesus&#39; righteousness was credited to you. You stand before God forgiven, accepted, beloved—based on Christ&#39;s finished work.

<strong>Glorified</strong> - Past tense. Even though it&#39;s future. Why? Because in God&#39;s eternal perspective, it&#39;s already done. The story is written. The ending is secure.

You will be glorified—fully redeemed, completely restored, eternally with Christ.

This is the theological anchor: your redemption is part of God&#39;s eternal purpose. He foreknew you. Predestined you. Called you. Justified you. And He will glorify you.

The story isn&#39;t in doubt. The ending is secure.

<h2>The Wayfarer Moment</h2>

<strong>Seeing my story in THE story.</strong>

For years, I thought my story was just mine. My struggles. My failures. My small attempts to get it right.

I&#39;d read the Bible as ancient history—good for principles, maybe, but not personally connected to my everyday life.

But then I started to see it.

I wasn&#39;t just crying out for help. I was participating in the pattern of cry and divine response that echoes through the Psalms.

And when I saw that—really saw it—everything changed.

The failures I&#39;d carried with shame weren&#39;t the end of my story. They were chapters in a larger redemption narrative. Like Peter&#39;s denial. Like Paul&#39;s persecution. Like Joseph&#39;s pit.

I&#39;m not the author. I&#39;m a character. But I&#39;m a beloved character in a story written by a good Author who knows how to turn crucifixions into resurrections.

And I know that in all things—ALL things—God is working for good. Nothing is wasted. Every pain has purpose. Every struggle is part of the redemption arc.

<h2>Song Integration</h2>

For years, my life felt like disconnected pieces. Random events. Unrelated struggles. Pain here, joy there, failure in one season, growth in another—but no coherent thread tying it all together.

I looked at my story and saw chaos. Mistakes I couldn&#39;t undo. Seasons that felt wasted. Suffering that seemed meaningless.

Then I encountered Romans 8:28-30 with fresh eyes: &quot;In all things God works for the good of those who love him... those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified.&quot; This isn&#39;t random. This isn&#39;t chaos. This is the redemption arc—Creation, Fall, Redemption, Restoration—written not just in the grand biblical narrative but in every individual life that turns toward God.

&quot;Redemption Story&quot; traces this arc from Genesis to Jesus to now. The song begins with creation—&quot;Before the stars adorned the night, the Word was spoken, creation came&quot;—grounding our personal stories in the larger Story of God&#39;s creative intent. We&#39;re not accidents. We&#39;re not meaningless biological events. We were made on purpose, for purpose, by a Creator who knew us before the foundation of the world. Every broken story, every wasted season, every painful chapter—all of it becomes raw material for the Redeemer who specializes in bringing beauty from ashes, making all things new.

<h2>Song Lyrics: (Redemption Story)</h2>

<strong>[Chorus]</strong>
From the beginning, His love was displayed,
Through every fall, His promise stayed.
A Savior&#39;s grace, a story divine,
Redemption secured for hearts like mine.

<strong>[Verse 1]</strong>
Before the stars adorned the night,
Before the sun gave earth its light,
The Word was spoken, creation came,
Through Jesus, the Maker, who knew our name.
He formed the earth, the skies, the seas,
Breathed life into humanity.
From dust we rose, His Spirit&#39;s flame,
To bear His image, to praise His name.

<strong>[Chorus]</strong>
From the beginning, His love was displayed,
Through every fall, His promise stayed.
A Savior&#39;s grace, a story divine,
Redemption secured for hearts like mine.

<strong>[Verse 2]</strong>
In Eden&#39;s garden, peace was found,
Until the serpent&#39;s lie unbound.
The fruit was taken, the fall began,
Sin entered the hearts of every man.
Yet even then, God&#39;s love remained,
A Savior promised to break the chain.
From Adam&#39;s sin to grace restored,
A plan of redemption from the Lord.

<strong>[Chorus]</strong>
From the beginning, His love was displayed,
Through every fall, His promise stayed.
A Savior&#39;s grace, a story divine,
Redemption secured for hearts like mine.

<strong>[Verse 3]</strong>
Through kings and prophets, His voice was heard,
Declaring His truth, His holy word.
David, the shepherd, a king would rise,
Through his line, the Savior arrive.
Isaiah spoke of a suffering King,
Who&#39;d bear our sins and salvation bring.
Elijah&#39;s fire, Daniel&#39;s stand,
God&#39;s faithfulness across the land.

<strong>[Chorus]</strong>
From the beginning, His love was displayed,
Through every fall, His promise stayed.
A Savior&#39;s grace, a story divine,
Redemption secured for hearts like mine.

<strong>[Bridge]</strong>
Oh, the cross, where mercy flows,
The empty grave, the story shows.
Sin defeated, love prevailed,
Through Christ alone, redemption hailed.
Oh, the cross, where hope is found,
His grace abounds, His love profound.
He bore the weight, the debt was paid,
In Him, the victory&#39;s displayed.

<strong>[Verse 4]</strong>
Mary, chosen, her heart so pure,
Through her, God&#39;s love would long endure.
She held the Savior, her baby boy,
The King of kings, her heart&#39;s great joy.
Did she know the cross He&#39;d face,
The pain, the nails, the world&#39;s disgrace?
Through grief, she trusted, through loss, she prayed,
Believing in the plan God made.

<strong>[Verse 5]</strong>
The leaders schemed, their hearts grew cold,
Blinded by power, they sought control.
They called Him a blasphemer, sentenced His death,
Yet love endured with His final breath.
Betrayed by a kiss for silver&#39;s gleam,
Denied by a friend in a broken dream.
Yet grace would triumph, death undone,
Victory through God&#39;s risen Son.

<strong>[Verse 6]</strong>
To die with Christ, to rise anew,
To walk His path, His love pursue.
The cross became the bridge to grace,
A gift of life in His embrace.
Through history&#39;s thread, His story flows,
A love eternal, a truth that grows.
My story now entwined with His,
A song of hope, a life that lives.

<strong>[Final Chorus]</strong>
From the beginning, His love was displayed,
Through every fall, His promise stayed.
A Savior&#39;s grace, a story divine,
Redemption secured for hearts like mine.

<strong>[Outro]</strong>
His story echoes through all of time,
A Savior&#39;s love, so pure, so kind.
One day we&#39;ll stand before His throne,
Forever redeemed, forever His own.

Look back at your life. Can you identify creation (who you were made to be), fall (your swamp), redemption (your water&#39;s edge), and restoration (the journey since then)? Be specific. Write it down using the framework in &quot;Practice: Telling Your Redemption Story&quot; below.</li>
</ol>

<h3>1. Creation - Who you were made to be</h3>

Before the swamp.. Before the brokenness..

<h3>2. Fall - Your swamp</h3>

Name it.. Be specific..

<h3>3. Redemption - Your water&#39;s edge encounter</h3>

When did you meet grace?. What was your turning point?.

<h3>4. Restoration - The journey since then</h3>

This is where you are now.. Between &quot;already redeemed&quot; and &quot;not yet fully restored.&quot; What has God been doing?.

<h3>5. Consummation - The hope ahead</h3>

How does the promise of final restoration shape how you live now?. One day, all things will be made new..

<h3>6. Share your story</h3>

Your redemption story isn&#39;t just for you.. It&#39;s a testimony of God&#39;s faithfulness that can encourage others..

<hr>

<h2>Closing Image</h2>

You&#39;re standing at the edge of a vast tapestry. So large you can&#39;t see the whole thing. So intricate you can&#39;t count the threads.

But you can see your section. The part you&#39;ve been working on. The threads you&#39;ve been weaving.

From up close, it looks messy. Dark threads mixed with light. Broken places where the pattern seems chaotic.

<strong>An Invitation to Believe the Impossible</strong>

You&#39;ve come through eleven chapters. You&#39;ve seen your story within God&#39;s story. You&#39;ve discovered purpose, rhythm, depth.

But now I need to ask you the hardest question yet:

<strong>When you look back at your life—really look back—what do you see?</strong>

Be honest. Do you see years in that toxic relationship? The job you stayed at too long because you were too afraid to leave? The ministry that blew up spectacularly? The friendships you let die because you were too proud? The opportunities you missed?

When you look back, do you see a timeline full of black holes? Years where nothing good grew. Nothing valuable was learned. Just... waste?

Here&#39;s the question that haunts many of us: <em>Can God really redeem this? Or are some things just... lost?</em>

The enemy whispers: &quot;Those years are gone. That potential is wasted. Those relationships are dead. You can&#39;t get it back. It&#39;s too late.&quot;

But here&#39;s what I&#39;ve discovered, and it&#39;s the most scandalous promise in Scripture:

<strong>In God&#39;s economy, nothing is wasted. Not &quot;almost nothing.&quot; Not &quot;most things.&quot; Nothing.</strong>

Every tear. Every failure. Every lost year. Every broken relationship. Every season you wish you could erase—God can redeem it all.

This doesn&#39;t mean the pain wasn&#39;t real. It doesn&#39;t mean the consequences don&#39;t matter. It doesn&#39;t minimize the loss.

It means God specializes in turning crucifixions into resurrections. He takes what looks like absolute waste and transforms it into raw material for redemption.

This chapter is about believing the impossible: that the years you thought were lost have been woven into a larger story of transformation.

That nothing—absolutely nothing—is wasted in His hands.

So before you continue, pause. This is hard to believe. I know. Consider:

<em>Can you say, even with doubt mixed in: &quot;God, I don&#39;t see how You can redeem those years. But I&#39;m willing to believe You can. I&#39;m willing to trust that even the seasons I wish I could erase are being woven into something purposeful. Show me how nothing is wasted.&quot;</em>

That&#39;s the prayer that opens eyes to redemption.

Because what comes next isn&#39;t just theological theory. It&#39;s the scandalous truth that changes how you see your entire timeline.

<hr>

Let&#39;s be brutally honest about what waste feels like. Because if you&#39;ve looked back at your timeline and seen black holes, you know this geography intimately.

Waste feels like:

<ul>
<li><strong>Time you can never recover.</strong> Years spent in patterns that brought nothing but destruction.</li>
<li><strong>Potential squandered.</strong> The person you could have become if you&#39;d made different choices.</li>
<li><strong>Relationships damaged beyond repair.</strong> Bridges burned. Trust shattered. No going back.</li>
<li><strong>Opportunities missed.</strong> Doors that closed while you were too paralyzed to walk through them.</li>
<li><strong>Lessons learned too late.</strong> Wisdom that came after the damage was already done.</li>
</ul>

This isn&#39;t just regret. Regret is &quot;I wish I&#39;d done that differently.&quot; Waste is &quot;That season contributed nothing. It&#39;s just gone.&quot;

And the question that haunts you: <em>Can God really redeem this? Or are some things just... lost?</em>

The enemy whispers: &quot;Those years are gone. That potential is wasted. Those relationships are dead. You can&#39;t get it back. It&#39;s too late.&quot;

But grace whispers something different: &quot;In God&#39;s economy, nothing is wasted. Not &#39;almost nothing.&#39; Not &#39;most things.&#39; Nothing.&quot;

Every tear. Every failure. Every lost year. Every broken relationship. Every season you wish you could erase—God can redeem it all.

This doesn&#39;t mean the pain wasn&#39;t real. It doesn&#39;t mean the consequences don&#39;t matter. It doesn&#39;t minimize the loss.

It means God specializes in turning crucifixions into resurrections. He takes what looks like absolute waste and transforms it into raw material for redemption.

This is the scandalous promise: nothing—absolutely nothing—is wasted in His hands.

<hr>

<h2>Key Themes</h2>

<h3>1. Timeline Reflection: The Sacred Work of Looking Back</h3>

Part of believing nothing is wasted is doing the hard work of timeline reflection. Not to dwell in the past, but to understand how the past has shaped the present.

This isn&#39;t nostalgia. It&#39;s not rumination. It&#39;s the intentional practice of asking:

<ul>
<li>What moments brought joy?</li>
<li>What moments brought pain?</li>
<li>What patterns emerged?</li>
<li>Where was grace at work even when I couldn&#39;t see it?</li>
</ul>

I&#39;ve done this exercise multiple times over the years. Drew my timeline. Marked the major seasons—the joyful ones and the painful ones. The seasons of growth and the seasons of wandering.

And every time, I discover the same thing: grace was present even when I couldn&#39;t feel it. God was working even when I couldn&#39;t see it.

The years I thought were wasted? They taught me what I couldn&#39;t learn anywhere else. My desperate need for grace. Compassion for others who struggle. The cost of pride and the beauty of humility.

Even the wasted years became the very years that prepared me for the work I&#39;m doing now.

Timeline reflection requires courage. It means looking honestly at seasons you&#39;d rather forget. But it also reveals something profound: grace threads through every season. Even the dark ones.

The thread of redemption. The thread that says: nothing is wasted.

<h3>2. Abraham and Isaac on Mount Moriah: The Test That Reveals</h3>

The story in Genesis 22 is one of the most challenging in all of Scripture. God asks Abraham to offer his son Isaac—the son of promise, the one through whom all nations would be blessed—as a sacrifice.

Abraham obeys. He takes Isaac up Mount Moriah. He builds the altar. He binds his son. He raises the knife.

And God provides a ram in the thicket. Isaac is spared. The promise is preserved.

<blockquote>
&quot;Abraham named the place Yahweh-Yireh (which means &#39;the LORD will provide&#39;). To this day, people still use that name as a proverb: &#39;On the mountain of the LORD it will be provided.&#39;&quot;

— Genesis 22:14 (NLT)
</blockquote>

What could have been the most tragic waste—the death of the promised son—becomes instead a revelation of God&#39;s character. The Lord provides. Always. Even when it seems impossible.

This is the promise for you: God specializes in last-minute provision. In eleventh-hour intervention. In turning what looks like absolute waste into absolute redemption.

The test itself wasn&#39;t wasted. The fear wasn&#39;t wasted. The faith required to obey wasn&#39;t wasted.

All of it became part of the story that would be told for generations: on the mountain of the Lord, it will be provided.

And in your life, the seasons that felt like tests—the moments when you had to let go of what you loved most, when you had to trust God with impossible outcomes—those weren&#39;t wasted either.

They were the ground where provision came. Where faith grew. Where you learned that God really does provide.

<h3>3. Romans 8:28 Rightly Understood</h3>

Perhaps no verse is more quoted—and more misunderstood—than Romans 8:28:

<blockquote>
&quot;And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.&quot;
</blockquote>

This doesn&#39;t mean everything that happens is good. It doesn&#39;t mean God causes evil so good can result. It doesn&#39;t mean we should minimize pain by slapping a spiritual Band-Aid on it.

What it does mean is this: God is relentlessly committed to redeeming every moment of your story. Even the worst ones. Even the ones that feel utterly wasted.

God is at work, weaving them into something good.

Not always good you can see in the moment. Sometimes not good you&#39;ll see in this lifetime. But good nonetheless. Eternal good. The kind of good that redeems every wasted season and makes it count for eternity.

I held this verse at arm&#39;s length for years. Because it felt like a platitude. Like minimizing real pain with Christian clichés.

But it&#39;s not a platitude. It&#39;s a promise. A promise that your pain has purpose. Your suffering isn&#39;t random. Your struggles aren&#39;t wasted.

God is working—actively, intentionally, lovingly—to bring good from it all.

<blockquote>
&quot;God wastes nothing—not even sin. The soul that has struggled and come through is enriched by its struggle, and the grace of God is not frustrated.&quot;
— Evelyn Underhill, <em>The Spiritual Life</em>
</blockquote>

<h3>4. Suffering to Compassion: The Transformation</h3>

One of the most profound ways God ensures nothing is wasted is by transforming our suffering into compassion. What once wounded us becomes the very thing that equips us to heal others.

<blockquote>
&quot;Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from God.&quot;

— 2 Corinthians 1:3-4
</blockquote>

Your struggle isn&#39;t wasted when it becomes the testimony that gives someone else hope.

Your scars aren&#39;t wasted when they become the proof that wounds can heal.

I&#39;ve seen this in my own life. The years I spent in the swamp? They weren&#39;t wasted. Because now when someone else is drowning, I can sit with them in the muck and say, &quot;I&#39;ve been here. I know this place. And there&#39;s a way out.&quot;

The toxic relationships I stayed in too long? They taught me about codependency, about people-pleasing, about the cost of losing yourself. And now I can help others recognize those patterns before the damage goes as deep.

The ministry position that blew up? It taught me about burnout, about the danger of deriving identity from what you do instead of who you are. And now I can warn others away from that cliff.

Nothing is wasted because every experience—even the painful ones—can become a gift to others.

The years you thought were lost become the very years that qualify you to speak into someone else&#39;s lostness.

The seasons you thought were wasted become the seasons that prepare you for kingdom work.

<h3>5. Counting the Cost: Present and Future</h3>

Timeline reflection looks backward. But the work of &quot;nothing is wasted&quot; also requires looking forward—counting the cost of present choices.

This isn&#39;t just about past choices and their consequences. It&#39;s about present ones.

What kind of life do I want to live now? What brings me life? What drains me? Am I pursuing what&#39;s actually fulfilling, or just what&#39;s familiar?

These questions themselves are grace—invitations to live more intentionally, more authentically, more aligned with who God is calling you to become.

Counting the cost means asking: If my future self could speak to me today, what would they want me to know? What choices would they be grateful I made? What patterns would they wish I&#39;d broken sooner?

This isn&#39;t anxiety about the future. It&#39;s wisdom. It&#39;s stewarding today in light of tomorrow. It&#39;s believing that even this moment—this choice, this breath, this step—matters eternally.

Nothing wasted means: this day counts. This conversation counts. This choice counts. Because God is redeeming not just your past, but your present and future too.

<h2>The Core Scripture Truth</h2>

<strong>Genesis 22:14</strong> - &quot;So Abraham called the name of that place, &#39;The Lord will provide&#39;; as it is said to this day, &#39;On the mount of the Lord it shall be provided.&#39;&quot;

<strong>Romans 8:28</strong> - &quot;And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.&quot;

These two passages—separated by centuries—speak the same truth: God is in the business of redemption. Of provision. Of ensuring that nothing is wasted in His hands.

Genesis 22 shows us God&#39;s character: He is the God who provides. Even when the test is unbearable. Even when obedience seems to contradict the promise. Even at the last possible moment. God provides.

Romans 8 shows us God&#39;s commitment: He works all things—not some things, but all things—for the good of those who love Him.

This isn&#39;t wishful thinking. It&#39;s covenant faithfulness. God has bound Himself to redeem your story, no matter how broken the chapters.

Together, these passages form the theological foundation for believing nothing is wasted:

<strong>God&#39;s provision is certain.</strong> On the mountain of the Lord—in your darkest moments, your most desperate situations—provision will be made. It may not come when you expect. It may not look like you imagined. But it will come.

<strong>God&#39;s redemption is comprehensive.</strong> All things. Not just the good things. Not just the spiritual things. All things. Every moment, every experience, every pain, every struggle—God is working it for good.

This doesn&#39;t mean the pain wasn&#39;t real. It doesn&#39;t mean the waste didn&#39;t hurt.

It means God specializes in turning waste into wonder. Ashes into beauty. Mourning into dancing.

In the economy of God, nothing is wasted. Each tear, each failure, each loss becomes an opportunity for grace.

<hr>

<h2>The Wayfarer Moment</h2>

<strong>The shift from regret to redemption doesn&#39;t happen all at once. It happens one memory at a time.</strong>

For years, I carried a deep sense of regret. Time wasted. Opportunities missed. Relationships broken. Years spent in patterns that brought nothing but pain.

I would look back and see waste. Just waste. And the weight of it was crushing.

But slowly—so slowly—I began to see differently. Not because the facts changed. But because my understanding of God&#39;s character deepened.

The mistakes taught me compassion for others who struggle.

I began doing timeline work—intentionally looking back at my life and tracing the thread of grace through every season. The joyful seasons and the painful ones. The seasons of growth and the seasons of wandering.

What felt like lost years became the very years that made me who I am.

And if God can redeem my wasteland, He can redeem yours too.

<h2>Song Integration</h2>

My therapist laid out the timeline of my life across the table and asked, &quot;Do you see the thread?&quot;

I didn&#39;t. All I saw were the wasted years.

The years I spent in addiction. The relationships I destroyed. The opportunities I squandered. The people I hurt. The potential I buried. All I could see was waste—years that could have been productive, holy, fruitful, but instead were consumed by my brokenness and sin.

But she kept pointing: &quot;Look at this season. What did you learn here? And here—who did you meet that changed everything? And this moment when you thought you were furthest from God—look what happened next.&quot; Slowly, reluctantly, I began to see it. The thread. Not a straight line of progress, but a meandering path of grace that wove through even my darkest seasons, redeeming what I thought was irredeemable.

&quot;Nothing is Wasted&quot; came from that session and countless ones after it. The song captures the scandalous promise of Romans 8:28—that God works ALL things together for good. Not just the good things. Not just the obedient seasons. Not just the victories. ALL things. Every failure becomes a lesson. Every wound becomes a source of compassion. Every wasted year becomes raw material in God&#39;s hands. This isn&#39;t cheap positivity or spiritual bypass. This is the costly, mysterious, relentless work of a Redeemer who refuses to let any part of our story—even the parts we&#39;re ashamed of—go unredeemed.

<h2>Song Lyrics: (Nothing is Wasted)</h2>

<strong>[Verse 1]</strong>
You asked me to let go of what I held too tight
The plans I made, the dreams I shaped, the pieces of my life
I tried to hold it all together, afraid of what I&#39;d lose
But love means laying down the outcome
And trusting everything to You

<strong>[Chorus]</strong>
You will provide, You always do
Even when I don&#39;t know what You&#39;re leading me through
Even when I walk through fire, You stay in the flame
You hold my sorrow, You know my name
In the valley, in the waiting, I have tasted
In the economy of Your love, nothing is wasted

<strong>[Verse 2]</strong>
I&#39;ve walked through days that felt like silence
And nights I couldn&#39;t catch my breath
I said I&#39;d follow where You led me
But I was scared of what came next
I couldn&#39;t see beyond the moment
Still You whispered, &quot;I am near&quot;
You never promised all the answers
You only asked me not to fear

<strong>[Chorus]</strong>
You will provide, You always do
Even when I don&#39;t know what You&#39;re leading me through
Even when I walk through fire, You stay in the flame
You hold my sorrow, You know my name
In the valley, in the waiting, I have tasted
In the economy of Your love, nothing is wasted

<strong>[Verse 3]</strong>
So here I am with hands wide open
Letting go of what I thought was mine
You never asked me for perfection
Just a heart that says, &quot;I&#39;ll try&quot;
And in the breaking, I found healing
In the loss, I found Your grace
You&#39;re the God who turns my ashes
Into beauty I can&#39;t replace

<strong>[Bridge]</strong>
You don&#39;t waste the waiting, You don&#39;t waste the pain
Even when I&#39;m walking through fire or rain
Every breath I breathe, every pain I&#39;ve tasted
In the economy of Your love, nothing is wasted

<strong>[Final Chorus]</strong>
You will provide, You always do
Even when I&#39;m breaking in two
Even when I walk through fire, You stay in the flame
You never leave me alone in the pain
In the valley, in the waiting, I have tasted
In the economy of Your love, nothing is wasted

<strong>[Outro]</strong>
So I lay it down again
Even when I don&#39;t understand
You are good... and nothing is wasted
You are near when I let go
You are strong when I feel low
You are kind... and nothing is wasted
You&#39;ve seen every tear I&#39;ve cried
Held my heart when hope had died
You stayed... and nothing is wasted
So I&#39;ll trust You in the silence
I&#39;ll believe You through the dark
You are faithful in the waiting
You are healing every part
I won&#39;t fear what comes tomorrow
I won&#39;t chase what&#39;s not mine to hold
You are God... and nothing is wasted

<hr>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>God redeems every wasted season.</strong> Romans 8:28 promises that God works ALL things—not just good things—together for good for those who love Him. Your painful past isn&#39;t disqualified; it&#39;s raw material for redemption.</li>
<li><strong>Suffering can birth compassion.</strong> The pain you&#39;ve walked through equips you to comfort others in similar struggles. Your wounds become the very thing that allows you to reach people no one else can.</li>
<li><strong>Count the cost, then trust the process.</strong> Following Jesus requires sacrifice, but what you gain far outweighs what you give up. The pearl of great price is worth selling everything else.</li>
<li><strong>Jehovah Jireh—God provides.</strong> Just as He provided a ram for Abraham when Isaac was on the altar, God provides what you need at the exact moment you need it. Trust His timing, not your anxiety.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Reflections for the Road</h2>

<strong>Questions for the Journey:</strong>

<ul>
<li>What season of your life feels most &quot;wasted&quot;? Name it. Where do you carry the most regret?</li>
<li>Do timeline work: Map your life in seasons. Mark the major ones—joyful and painful. Where do you see patterns? Where do you see the thread of grace?</li>
<li>What suffering in your life might God want to transform into compassion for others? Where have you been wounded? How might that pain become the bridge to someone else&#39;s healing?</li>
<li>Read Genesis 22 and Romans 8:28 slowly. What is God saying to you about provision and redemption?</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>1. Draw your timeline</h3>

On a large piece of paper, draw a horizontal line representing your life from birth to now. Mark major life events.

<h3>2. Mark the spiritual seasons</h3>

Using different colors, mark seasons of growth, wandering, suffering, joy.. Be honest..

<h3>3. Look for the thread of grace</h3>

Go back over your timeline and look for moments of grace—even in the hardest seasons.. Where did God show up?.

<h3>4. Name what you&#39;re learning</h3>

For each major season, write a one-sentence summary of what you learned or how you grew.. Even the painful seasons..

<h3>5. Write a prayer of redemption</h3>

End by asking God to redeem every season. To use even the wasted years for His glory and your good.

<hr>

<h2>Closing Image</h2>

You&#39;re standing on the mountain now. Not Mount Moriah exactly, but your own mountain. The place where you&#39;ve laid down what you held most dear.

And as you look back down the mountain at the path you&#39;ve climbed, you see something you missed on the way up.

Every step—even the ones that felt like backsliding. Every turn—even the wrong ones. Every season—even the wasted ones. They all led here.

<h3>MOVEMENT 3: UNFORCED RHYTHMS OF LIFE (The Transformation)</h3>

<h3>Chapter 13: Devil&#39;s On The Run</h3>

triumphing over them by the cross.&quot;

<hr>

<strong>An Invitation to Stand</strong>

You&#39;ve walked through twelve chapters. You&#39;ve experienced rescue, rhythm, depth, redemption. You&#39;ve discovered that nothing is wasted.

But now I need to ask you something crucial:

<strong>When the accusations come at 3 AM—when they feel true—do you know where you&#39;re standing?</strong>

You know these voices. They always show up in the dark, in the quiet, when you&#39;re too tired to fight back effectively:

<em>You&#39;re not really forgiven. God&#39;s still angry. You&#39;ve failed too many times. You&#39;ll never be free. This sin is too big.</em>

And here&#39;s what makes it so hard: sometimes it feels like all the progress you&#39;ve made is fragile. One accusation away from crumbling.

The enemy whispers: <em>See? You haven&#39;t really changed. This is who you are. This is who you&#39;ll always be.</em>

But here&#39;s what I&#39;ve discovered, and it&#39;s the truth that changes the battle:

<strong>This isn&#39;t a fight for victory. It&#39;s a fight from victory.</strong>

The war is already over. The enemy has already been defeated. You&#39;re not fighting to win—you&#39;re enforcing the win that&#39;s already been won.

Colossians 2:15 says: &quot;Having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.&quot;

Disarmed. Public spectacle. Triumphed.

Past tense. Done. Finished.

This chapter is about the fundamental shift from desperate warfare to confident standing. From fighting for freedom to standing in freedom. From resisting from fear to resisting from rest.

The devil is on the run. Not because you&#39;re strong. Because Christ is victorious.

And you—standing in Christ&#39;s victory—don&#39;t have to earn freedom. You just have to stand in the freedom that&#39;s already yours.

So before you continue, pause. Consider:

<em>Can you say, even when the accusations feel true: &quot;Jesus, the cross. The cross settles this. I&#39;m not fighting for victory—I&#39;m standing in victory. The enemy is defeated. I resist from rest, and he flees.&quot;</em>

That&#39;s the declaration that shifts the battle.

Because what comes next isn&#39;t about fighting harder. It&#39;s about standing firmer.

<hr>

Let&#39;s be honest about what spiritual warfare feels like. Because if you&#39;ve been in the fight, you know it&#39;s not theoretical. It&#39;s visceral.

Spiritual warfare feels like:

<ul>
<li><strong>Accusations that feel true.</strong> &quot;You&#39;re not really forgiven. God&#39;s still angry. You&#39;ve failed too many times.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Temptations perfectly tailored to your weaknesses.</strong> The enemy knows where you&#39;re vulnerable.</li>
<li><strong>Despair that whispers &quot;give up.&quot;</strong> What&#39;s the point? You&#39;ll never change. This is who you are.</li>
<li><strong>Isolation.</strong> The lie that you&#39;re alone. That no one else struggles like this. That if people knew, they&#39;d reject you.</li>
<li><strong>Confusion.</strong> Feeling like you can&#39;t tell God&#39;s voice from the enemy&#39;s lies from your own thoughts.</li>
</ul>

But here&#39;s the shift: spiritual warfare from victory feels different.

When you&#39;re fighting from victory instead of for victory, the battle changes:

<ul>
<li><strong>Accusations lose their power.</strong> Not because they stop coming, but because you know they&#39;re lies. The cross settles it.</li>
<li><strong>Temptations don&#39;t define you.</strong> You&#39;re not your struggles. You&#39;re beloved. The temptation is an attack, not an identity.</li>
<li><strong>Despair has no ground.</strong> Hope is anchored in Christ&#39;s finished work, not your performance.</li>
<li><strong>Isolation breaks.</strong> You&#39;re part of a body. Connected. Not alone.</li>
<li><strong>Truth becomes clear.</strong> God&#39;s voice sounds like grace. The enemy&#39;s voice sounds like accusation. And you&#39;re learning the difference.</li>
</ul>

The battlefield is still real. The enemy still attacks. But you&#39;re not desperately fighting for freedom anymore.

You&#39;re standing in freedom. Enforcing victory. Resisting from rest.

<hr>

<h2>Key Themes</h2>

<h3>1. Fighting From Victory, Not For Victory</h3>

This is the fundamental shift. And it changes everything.

When you&#39;re fighting for victory, every battle feels desperate. Every temptation is a potential defeat. Every accusation carries the weight of judgment. You&#39;re trying to earn something, prove something, secure something through your effort.

But when you&#39;re fighting from victory, the pressure&#39;s off. You&#39;re not trying to earn freedom—you&#39;re protecting freedom that&#39;s already yours. You&#39;re not hoping to overcome—you&#39;re standing in the overcoming power of Christ.

James 4:7: &quot;Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.&quot;

Notice what it doesn&#39;t say. It doesn&#39;t say &quot;fight the devil until you&#39;re exhausted, and maybe he&#39;ll leave.&quot;

It says resist, and he will flee. Automatic. Guaranteed. The fleeing isn&#39;t something you make happen—it&#39;s the result of your positioning.

You resist, and he runs. Every time.

Why? Because he&#39;s already defeated. And he knows it.

You&#39;re not fighting to win. Christ won. You&#39;re enforcing that win. Standing in that victory. And when you do, the enemy has no choice but to flee.

C.S. Lewis explains the Christian&#39;s unique position:

<blockquote>
&quot;The Christian is in a different position from other people who are trying to be good. They hope, by being good, to please God if there is one; or—if they think there is not—at least they hope to deserve approval from good men. But the Christian thinks any good he does comes from the Christ-life inside him.&quot;
— C.S. Lewis, <em>Mere Christianity</em>
</blockquote>

We&#39;re not fighting in our own strength. We&#39;re fighting from Christ&#39;s strength already at work in us.

<h3>2. The Lies of the Enemy vs. The Truth of Grace</h3>

The devil&#39;s primary weapon isn&#39;t force—it&#39;s deception. He can&#39;t take your salvation. He can&#39;t reverse what Christ has done. But he can lie to you about it.

And if he can get you to believe the lies, he can render you ineffective.

<em>&quot;You&#39;re not really forgiven.&quot;</em>
<em>&quot;God is still angry with you.&quot;</em>
<em>&quot;You&#39;ve failed too many times.&quot;</em>
<em>&quot;You&#39;ll never be free.&quot;</em>
<em>&quot;This sin is too big for grace.&quot;</em>

Lies. All of them. But lies that feel true when you&#39;re in the swamp, when you&#39;re struggling, when you can&#39;t see clearly.

The antidote is truth. Not just knowing it intellectually, but anchoring your identity in it.

<strong>You are forgiven—completely, fully, eternally:</strong>

<blockquote>
&quot;But if we confess our sins to him, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all wickedness.&quot;
— 1 John 1:9 (NLT)
</blockquote>

<strong>God is not angry with you—His wrath was satisfied at the cross:</strong>

<blockquote>
&quot;Therefore, since we have been made right in God&#39;s sight by faith, we have peace with God because of what Jesus Christ our Lord has done for us.&quot;
— Romans 5:1 (NLT)
</blockquote>

<strong>Your failures don&#39;t define you—Christ&#39;s righteousness does:</strong>

<blockquote>
&quot;For God made Christ, who never sinned, to be the offering for our sin, so that we could be made right with God through Christ.&quot;
— 2 Corinthians 5:21 (NLT)
</blockquote>

You are free—the chains are broken, the prison door is open (John 8:36).
No sin is too big for grace—grace is bigger than all of them combined (Romans 5:20).

When you stand in these truths, the lies lose their power. The accusations fall flat. The enemy has nothing to work with.

Because truth always defeats lies. And grace always trumps accusation.

<blockquote>
&quot;The devil is a better theologian than any of us and is a devil still.&quot;
— A.W. Tozer, <em>The Knowledge of the Holy</em>
</blockquote>

The enemy knows Scripture. He knows theology. But knowledge without submission is worthless. We don&#39;t defeat him with superior arguments—we defeat him by standing in the truth of who we are in Christ.

<h3>3. Colossians 2:15 – The Public Spectacle</h3>

One of the most powerful verses about spiritual warfare is Colossians 2:15:

<blockquote>
&quot;And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.&quot;
</blockquote>

This is the picture: Jesus on the cross, seemingly defeated. The enemy celebrating. But in that moment of apparent defeat, Jesus is actually stripping the enemy of every weapon, every claim, every authority.

And then—resurrection. The ultimate reversal. Death swallowed up in victory. The grave defeated. Satan disarmed. A public spectacle made of all the powers of darkness.

Disarmed. Every weapon the enemy had—sin, death, condemnation, accusation—was stripped away. He has no legitimate claim. No legal ground. No authority.

Public spectacle. The victory wasn&#39;t secret or private. It was public. Visible. Undeniable. The powers of darkness were put on display—defeated, humiliated, powerless.

Triumphing. This is the language of a victory parade. Jesus didn&#39;t just win—He celebrated. The cross wasn&#39;t Plan B. It was the plan. And it worked perfectly.

This is why the devil is on the run. He has no authority anymore. His power was stripped at the cross. His claims were nullified in the resurrection. All he has left are lies and fear—and both crumble in the presence of truth and faith.

Charles Stanley identifies the enemy&#39;s real strategy:

<blockquote>
&quot;Satan&#39;s primary objective is not to lead you into a blatant sin. It&#39;s to get you to live independently of God.&quot;
— Charles Stanley, <em>When the Enemy Strikes</em>
</blockquote>

This is the core battle. Not spectacular moral failures, but subtle independence. Living like you don&#39;t need God. Making decisions without Him. Trusting yourself instead of Him. This is where the real warfare happens.

<h3>4. The Danger of Giving the Enemy Too Much Credit</h3>

There&#39;s a danger on the other side of spiritual warfare: giving the devil too much credit. Making him seem more powerful than he is. Living in constant fear of his schemes.

But the truth is, the devil is a defeated foe. He&#39;s on a leash. His time is limited. His power is broken. And he has no authority over those who are in Christ.

This doesn&#39;t mean we ignore spiritual warfare. It means we engage it from the right posture—not fear, but confidence. Not paranoia, but awareness. Not obsession with the enemy, but focus on Christ.

Some Christians see a demon behind every bush. Others deny the reality of spiritual warfare altogether. The truth is in the middle: the enemy is real, but he&#39;s already defeated.

We need to be aware, but not afraid. Alert, but not anxious. Resisting, but resting in Christ&#39;s victory.

The devil is on the run. That&#39;s the truth. But don&#39;t spend your life looking over your shoulder for him.

Keep your eyes on Jesus. Stand firm in truth. And when the enemy shows up with his lies and accusations, resist him with confidence—knowing that he has no choice but to flee.

<h3>5. Walking in Freedom, Not Just Fighting for It</h3>

The ultimate goal of understanding spiritual warfare isn&#39;t just to fight better—it&#39;s to walk in freedom. To live in the victory that Christ has won. To stop constantly battling and start consistently abiding.

Too many Christians spend their entire lives in spiritual warfare mode—always fighting, always resisting, always on guard. And while vigilance is important, it&#39;s not the whole picture.

The whole picture is this: Christ has set you free. The chains are broken. The prison door is open. The devil is defeated.

Your job isn&#39;t to keep fighting for that freedom. It&#39;s to walk in it. To live from it. To let it shape how you think, how you respond, how you engage with life.

Galatians 5:1: &quot;It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery.&quot;

Stand firm in freedom. Don&#39;t go back to slavery. Don&#39;t pick up chains that Christ has already broken. Don&#39;t believe lies that Christ has already exposed as false.

The devil is on the run. And you&#39;re free to live like it.

<h2>The Core Scripture Truth</h2>

<strong>Colossians 2:13-15</strong> - &quot;And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.&quot;

The cross is the turning point of all spiritual warfare. What looked like defeat was actually the decisive victory.

Jesus didn&#39;t just survive the enemy&#39;s attack—He dismantled it.

<strong>Disarmed.</strong> Every weapon the enemy had—sin, death, condemnation, accusation—was stripped away. He has no legitimate claim. No legal ground. No authority.

<strong>Public spectacle.</strong> The victory wasn&#39;t secret or private. It was public. Visible. Undeniable. The powers of darkness were put on display—defeated, humiliated, powerless.

<strong>Triumphing.</strong> This is the language of a victory parade. Jesus didn&#39;t just win—He celebrated. The cross wasn&#39;t Plan B. It was the plan. And it worked perfectly.

This is the theological foundation for &quot;the devil is on the run.&quot; Not wishful thinking. Not positive confession. Not spiritual bravado.

Reality. Accomplished fact. The cross changed everything.

Ephesians 6:10-11: &quot;Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil&#39;s schemes.&quot;

Notice: you&#39;re strong in the Lord, not in yourself. The armor is God&#39;s armor, not your own. And the call is to stand, not to fight for ground you don&#39;t have.

You&#39;re holding ground that&#39;s already been won. Standing in victory that&#39;s already been secured. Resisting an enemy who&#39;s already been defeated.

This is spiritual warfare from rest. From confidence. From the unforced rhythms of grace.

And in Him, you share that victory.

<hr>

<h2>The Wayfarer Moment</h2>

The shift from fighting for victory to fighting from victory changed everything for me.

For years, I felt like I was barely holding on. Every temptation was a potential defeat. Every accusation felt true. Every battle left me exhausted, wondering if I&#39;d survive the next one.

I was fighting for victory—trying to earn it, prove it, secure it through my effort and willpower.

Wait. The enemy is already disarmed? Already defeated? Already on the run?

And slowly—so slowly—I began to shift. From fighting for victory to fighting from victory. From desperation to confidence. From fear to faith.

And every time I stood on truth, the lies lost their power. The accusations fell flat. The enemy fled.

But more and more, I&#39;m living from victory instead of for it. Resisting from rest instead of from fear. Standing in confidence because Christ has already triumphed.

<h2>Song Integration</h2>

The attack came when I thought I was finally safe. I&#39;d been out of the swamp, washed at the water&#39;s edge, learning the rhythms, sending roots deep. Then the accusations started—relentless, day and night. &quot;You&#39;re not really changed. You&#39;ll always be that person. You&#39;ll never be free.&quot; I was exhausted, barely holding on, wondering if the enemy was right. I was fighting for my freedom, fighting to prove I was really changed, fighting to hold onto ground I&#39;d gained. And I was losing.

Then something happened. I was reading Colossians 2, barely able to focus, when verse 15 leaped off the page: <em>&quot;Having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.&quot;</em> Three words stopped me: <strong>Disarmed. Public spectacle. Triumphed.</strong> In that moment, I realized what I&#39;d been doing wrong.

<h2>Song Lyrics: (Devil&#39;s On The Run)</h2>

<strong>[Verse 1]</strong>
Devil on the run
He&#39;s a wicked beast
Tried to take me down
But he lost his feast
He kicked me hard
Left me buried deep
But I rose in grace
While he lost his keep

<strong>[Verse 2]</strong>
In my darkest night
I forgot the gift I had
He pulled me low
Told me lies and made me mad
But even in the pit
Jesus called my name
Now I walk in light
I&#39;m not the same

<strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong>
Don&#39;t be fooled
By the snake in the weeds
He don&#39;t care
&#39;Bout your hope or your needs
He can&#39;t give life
Only takes what you earn
He&#39;ll torch it all
Just to watch it burn

<strong>[Chorus]</strong>
Now I rise, now I run
By the power of the Son
But the Devil is a liar
He&#39;s Done!!
Ain&#39;t no grace where he&#39;s from
Tried to steal, tried to kill
But my soul he couldn&#39;t take
Devil&#39;s on the run
&#39;Cause I&#39;m saved by grace

<strong>[Verse 3]</strong>
Chains are gone
Yeah, the stone rolled back
He lost the war
On a bloodstained track
Truth is fire
And the lie won&#39;t stand
I&#39;m a child of God
With a sword in my hand

<strong>[Chorus – repeat]</strong>
Now I rise, now I run
By the power of the Son
But the Devil is a liar
He&#39;s Done!!
Ain&#39;t no grace where he&#39;s from
Tried to steal, tried to kill
But my soul he couldn&#39;t take
Devil&#39;s on the run
&#39;Cause I&#39;m saved by grace

<strong>[Bridge – Breakdown / Call &amp; Response]</strong>
Oh the blood!
Oh the Lamb!
Crushed the devil
With a mighty hand
Ain&#39;t no grave!
Gonna hold me down!
I&#39;ve been bought
And I wear the crown
You can growl
You can scream
But you can&#39;t run
From the King
Devil&#39;s on the run—
He lost everything

<strong>[Final Chorus – Tag out strong]</strong>
Now I rise, now I run
By the power of the Son
But the Devil is a liar
He&#39;s Done!!
Ain&#39;t no grace where he&#39;s from
Tried to steal, tried to kill
But my soul he couldn&#39;t take
Devil&#39;s on the run
Yeah, the devil&#39;s on the run
Jesus won — and I&#39;m saved by grace

<hr>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Fight from victory, not for victory.</strong> The battle was won at the cross. You&#39;re not fighting to defeat the enemy—you&#39;re enforcing Christ&#39;s already-accomplished victory by standing firm in truth.</li>
<li><strong>The devil is already defeated.</strong> Colossians 2:15 declares that Jesus disarmed the powers and authorities and made a public spectacle of them. Don&#39;t give a defeated enemy more credit than he deserves.</li>
<li><strong>Lies lose power when exposed to truth.</strong> The enemy&#39;s primary weapon is deception. When you identify the lie and speak God&#39;s truth over it, the stronghold crumbles. Light always dispels darkness.</li>
<li><strong>Walk in the freedom Christ secured.</strong> You&#39;re not in bondage anymore—you&#39;re free. Live like it. Resist the devil from a place of rest, not fear, knowing he must flee when you stand firm.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Reflections for the Road</h2>

<strong>Questions for the Journey:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Where are you still fighting for victory instead of from victory? What battles feel desperate? Where do you feel like you&#39;re barely holding on?</li>
<li>What lies has the enemy been whispering to you? Write them down. Be specific. Now counter each lie with Scripture. Find the truth that exposes the lie.</li>
<li>Read Colossians 2:15 slowly. What does it mean that Jesus &quot;disarmed&quot; the enemy? What weapons does the enemy no longer have?</li>
<li>Are you giving the devil too much credit—or not enough? What would a balanced approach look like?</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>1. Identify the lie</h3>

What is the enemy whispering to you?. What accusation feels most powerful?.

<h3>2. Find the countering truth</h3>

Search Scripture for the truth that directly counters the lie. For example:

<ul>
<li>Lie: &quot;You&#39;re not really forgiven.&quot; Truth: 1 John 1:9, Colossians 1:13-14</li>
<li>Lie: &quot;God is angry with you.&quot; Truth: Romans 5:1, Romans 8:1</li>
<li>Lie: &quot;You&#39;ll never be free.&quot; Truth: John 8:36, Galatians 5:1</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Declare the truth out loud</h3>

Don&#39;t just think it.. Speak it..

<h3>4. Stand firm</h3>

The lie will come back.. That&#39;s what the enemy does..

<h3>5. Thank God for the victory</h3>

End by thanking God for the victory that&#39;s already been won.. For the truth that sets you free..

<hr>

<h2>Closing Image</h2>

You&#39;re standing on the battlefield, but the battle is over. The smoke is clearing. The enemy is retreating. And you realize—you didn&#39;t win this fight. Christ did.

The victory was secured long before you arrived. The cross was the decisive blow. The resurrection was the final confirmation. The enemy was disarmed, defeated, sent running.

Your role wasn&#39;t to win. It was to stand. To hold the ground that Christ won. To resist an enemy who has no choice but to flee.

<strong>An Invitation to Be Here</strong>

You&#39;ve journeyed through thirteen chapters. From swamp to water&#39;s edge. From crisis to rhythm. From scattered to rooted. From waste to redemption. From defeat to victory.

But now I need to ask you one final question:

Not physically. Mentally. Emotionally. Spiritually.

<strong>Breath.</strong> Deep, full, unforced. Not gasping for what&#39;s gone or hyperventilating about what&#39;s coming.

<ul>
<li><strong>Attention.</strong> Actually listening to the person in front of you instead of mentally rehearsing your response.</li>
<li><strong>Gratitude.</strong> Noticing what&#39;s here instead of obsessing over what&#39;s missing.</li>
<li><strong>Rest.</strong> Not from activity, but in activity. Working from presence instead of from anxiety.</li>
<li><strong>Trust.</strong> Believing that today&#39;s grace is sufficient for today. And tomorrow&#39;s will come tomorrow.</li>
</ul>

But here&#39;s what living in the present might also feel like, at least at first:

<ul>
<li><strong>Discomfort.</strong> Because the present requires you to feel what you&#39;ve been avoiding.</li>
<li><strong>Boredom.</strong> Because you&#39;re so used to constant stimulation and distraction.</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerability.</strong> Because being here means acknowledging what&#39;s actually true right now.</li>
<li><strong>Fear.</strong> Because if you&#39;re not planning for tomorrow or fixing yesterday, what if everything falls apart?</li>
</ul>

This is normal. Because presence challenges everything our culture teaches us about productivity, control, and security.

Our culture says: Plan everything. Control outcomes. Never slow down.

Grace says: Be here now. Trust God with outcomes. Rest is not weakness.

Presence is a practice. A discipline. A choice you make moment by moment to come back here, to this breath, to this moment, to this sufficient grace.

<hr>

<h2>Key Themes</h2>

<h3>1. God&#39;s Name is &quot;I AM&quot; – Present Tense</h3>

<blockquote>
&quot;I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: I AM has sent me to you.&quot;

— Exodus 3:14
</blockquote>

Present tense. Always.

God isn&#39;t just the God of your past—though He was faithful there. He isn&#39;t just the God of your future—though He&#39;ll be faithful there too.

He is the God of your present. Here. Now. In this moment.

This changes everything. Because if God is present-tense, then His grace is present-tense too. Not stored up from yesterday. Not held back until tomorrow. Here. Now. Sufficient for this moment.

Paul writes: &quot;My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness&quot; (2 Corinthians 12:9).

Sufficient. Not abundant for tomorrow. Not excess for next week. Sufficient for today. For this moment. For this need.

That&#39;s all you need. And it&#39;s enough.

I spent years trying to secure tomorrow&#39;s grace today. Planning obsessively. Preparing for every contingency. Trying to control outcomes that weren&#39;t mine to control.

And I was exhausted. Anxious. Never present.

But when I learned to trust that God&#39;s grace is sufficient for this moment—and that tomorrow&#39;s grace will come tomorrow—I began to rest.

Not the rest of inactivity. The rest of presence. Being here. Trusting now.

Jesus addresses our tendency to borrow tomorrow&#39;s worries:

<blockquote>
&quot;Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.&quot;

— Matthew 6:34
</blockquote>

This isn&#39;t fatalism. It&#39;s wisdom.

Today has enough to carry. Don&#39;t make it heavier by adding what hasn&#39;t happened yet.

I&#39;m a worrier by nature. My mind races to worst-case scenarios. What if this happens? What if that fails? What if everything falls apart?

And Jesus says: Stop. Come back to today. Today has enough. You don&#39;t need to carry tomorrow too.

This is freedom. Real freedom. The freedom to engage fully with what&#39;s right in front of you instead of being paralyzed by what might come.

Living in the moment doesn&#39;t mean being oblivious to the future. It means trusting that God will give you what you need when you need it. That tomorrow&#39;s grace will come tomorrow. That today&#39;s grace is sufficient for today.

Corrie ten Boom, who lived through the horrors of a Nazi concentration camp, learned this truth:

<blockquote>
&quot;Worry does not empty tomorrow of its sorrow. It empties today of its strength.&quot;

— Corrie ten Boom, <em>Clippings from My Notebook</em>
</blockquote>

If anyone had reason to worry about tomorrow, it was Corrie. But she discovered that borrowing tomorrow&#39;s troubles only robs today of the grace needed to live it well.

<h3>3. The Manna Experience: Daily Bread</h3>

When Israel wandered in the wilderness, God provided manna every morning. Daily bread. But the instruction was clear: gather only what you need for today. Don&#39;t try to hoard tomorrow&#39;s provision.

Those who tried to keep extra found it rotting by morning. The lesson: trust today&#39;s provision for today. Tomorrow will have its own.

This is living in the moment. Not grasping for more than you need. Not anxiously securing tomorrow. Just receiving today&#39;s grace and trusting tomorrow&#39;s will come.

<blockquote>
&quot;Give us this day our daily bread.&quot;

— Matthew 6:11
</blockquote>

Not weekly bread. Not monthly bread. Daily bread.

<h3>4. Mary and Martha: The Better Choice</h3>

The story of Mary and Martha (Luke 10:38-42) perfectly captures the tension between doing and being, between productivity and presence.

Martha is distracted by preparations—good things, necessary things. But she&#39;s missing the moment. Missing the presence of Jesus right there in her home.

Mary, on the other hand, sits at Jesus&#39; feet. Present. Attentive. Fully engaged in the moment.

Jesus&#39; words to Martha are gentle but clear:

<blockquote>
&quot;Martha, Martha, you are worried and upset about many things, but few things are needed—or indeed only one. Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her.&quot;

— Luke 10:41-42
</blockquote>

The better choice: presence over productivity. Being over doing. This moment with Jesus over the endless list of tasks.

This doesn&#39;t mean tasks don&#39;t matter. It means they&#39;re not the ultimate thing.

The ultimate thing is being present to God&#39;s presence. Being attentive to this moment. Being fully here.

I&#39;ve been Martha most of my life. Busy. Productive. Distracted by preparations. Always doing.

And I&#39;ve missed moments. Beautiful, sacred, unrepeatable moments because I was too busy to be present.

I&#39;m learning—slowly—to choose Mary&#39;s part. To sit. To be. To let the tasks wait while I&#39;m fully present to what matters most.

<h3>5. Practices of Presence</h3>

<h3>6. Fixing Your Eyes on Jesus</h3>

Hebrews 12:1-2: &quot;Let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith.&quot;

The race is now. The moment is here. Fix your eyes.

Not backward eyes that live in regret.

Fixed eyes. On Jesus. On this moment. On the grace that&#39;s present right now.

Choosing to see this moment—not as a means to an end, but as the place where God is present.

Choosing to focus on what you can control—your response, your attitude, your obedience—and release what you can&#39;t.

Choosing to look at Jesus instead of at the waves. At truth instead of at fear. At grace instead of at guilt.

<hr>

<h2>The Core Scripture Truth</h2>

<strong>Hebrews 12:1-2</strong> - &quot;Let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith.&quot;

This passage captures the theology of living in the moment.

The race isn&#39;t in the past—those miles are behind you. The race isn&#39;t in the future—those miles haven&#39;t arrived yet. The race is now. This step. This breath. This moment.

And the key to running it well? Fixing your eyes on Jesus.

Not on the finish line so far you can&#39;t see it. Not on the starting line you&#39;ve already left. On Jesus. Who is present. Here. Now.

<strong>Pioneer and perfecter.</strong> Jesus has run this race. He knows the way. And He&#39;s with you—not just at the finish, but in this moment.

This is the theological foundation for living in the moment: God is not just the God of your past or your future. He is the God of your present.

The great &quot;I AM&quot;—not &quot;I was&quot; or &quot;I will be,&quot; but &quot;I AM.&quot; Present tense. Here. Now.

<blockquote>
&quot;But he said to me, &#39;My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.&#39;&quot;

— 2 Corinthians 12:9
</blockquote>

Sufficient. Not abundant for tomorrow. Not stored up for next week. Sufficient for today. For this moment. For this need.

That&#39;s all you need. And it&#39;s enough.

<hr>

<h2>The Wayfarer Moment</h2>

The shift from living in anxiety to living in the moment changed everything for me.

For years, I lived in two time zones: yesterday and tomorrow. I carried regrets from the past and anxieties about the future. The only time zone I wasn&#39;t living in was the present.

And I was exhausted. Haunted by what I&#39;d done wrong. Terrified of what might go wrong. Never fully present to what was actually happening.

But slowly, I began to practice presence. Small things at first.

I started asking myself: What does faithfulness look like right now? Not tomorrow. Not in the big picture. Right now.

I&#39;m still learning. My mind still wanders to yesterday&#39;s failures and tomorrow&#39;s fears. But more and more, I&#39;m able to return. To this moment. To this breath. To this sufficient grace.

<hr>

<h2>Song Integration</h2>

I&#39;d spent most of my life living anywhere but the present moment. My mind was either in the past—replaying conversations, regretting decisions, obsessing over what I should have said—or in the future—catastrophizing outcomes, trying to control variables I couldn&#39;t control. The present? I was rarely there. Because the present required me to feel, to be vulnerable, to acknowledge what was actually true right now.

Anxiety was my constant companion. The low-grade, ever-present anxiety of someone who can&#39;t trust God with the moment in front of him. I was always preparing, always planning, always trying to get ahead of the next crisis. And I was exhausted.

<hr>

<h2>Song Lyrics: (This Moment is Enough)</h2>

<strong>[Verse 1]</strong>
In the garden mercy covered the fall,
Two hearts broken, yet God heard the call.
The waters rose, but His promise remained,
A rainbow whispered through the pouring rain.
Love was alive in the moment back then.

<strong>[Chorus]</strong>
We&#39;re not promised tomorrow, only the breath we breathe.
Here in this moment, God&#39;s mercy never leaves.
From Genesis to Jesus, the story carries us—
This moment is the promise,
This moment is enough.

<strong>[Verse 2]</strong>
Abraham walked with nothing in hand,
Trusting the covenant, trusting God&#39;s plan.
Years went by, but His word held fast,
A future was born from a simple &quot;yes.&quot;
Faith is alive in the moment we live.

<strong>[Chorus]</strong>
We&#39;re not promised tomorrow, only the breath we breathe.
Here in this moment, God&#39;s mercy never leaves.
From Genesis to Jesus, the story carries us—
This moment is the promise,
This moment is enough.

<strong>[Bridge]</strong>
These ancient stories are the ground beneath our feet,
The God of creation still makes our lives complete.
From the garden to the cross, from the grave to today,
The God who redeemed them is redeeming us the same.

<strong>[Verse 3 – Final Verse]</strong>
The prophets proclaimed what the Father would do,
Messiah would come, make all things new.
From Isaiah&#39;s promise to shepherds&#39; surprise,
The Word became flesh before human eyes.
Love took on skin in the moment Divine.

<strong>[Chorus – Final]</strong>
We&#39;re not promised tomorrow, but love is here today.
The God of all beginnings is guiding every step we take.
From Genesis to Jesus, His story carries on—
This moment is the promise,
This moment leads us home.

<strong>[Outro]</strong>
The story isn&#39;t over, the story lives in us.
This moment is a gift of grace—
This moment is enough.

This moment is a gift of grace—
This moment is enough.

<hr>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>God&#39;s name is &quot;I AM&quot;—present tense, not past or future.</strong> He meets you in this moment, not in yesterday&#39;s regrets or tomorrow&#39;s anxieties. This moment is where His presence and grace are available.</li>
<li><strong>Sufficient grace for today is enough.</strong> Like manna in the wilderness, God&#39;s grace is given daily. Don&#39;t hoard yesterday&#39;s grace or borrow tomorrow&#39;s worry—receive what&#39;s here, now.</li>
<li><strong>Presence over productivity.</strong> Mary chose the better part—sitting at Jesus&#39; feet—while Martha stressed over serving. Being with God matters more than doing for God.</li>
<li><strong>Fix your eyes on Jesus, not the waves.</strong> Hebrews 12:2 urges you to focus on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith. When you look at circumstances, you sink. When you look at Him, you walk on water.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Reflections for the Road</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>Where do you spend most of your mental energy—past, present, or future?</strong>
Be honest. Are you replaying yesterday&#39;s conversations? Rehearsing tomorrow&#39;s scenarios? Catastrophizing outcomes that may never happen? Notice where your mind goes when it wanders. Write it down.

What is one specific thing you&#39;re carrying from yesterday or borrowing from tomorrow that&#39;s weighing down your today?
</li>
<li><strong>Read Exodus 3:14 and Matthew 6:34 slowly.</strong>
&quot;I AM WHO I AM&quot; (Exodus 3:14). God&#39;s name is present tense. And Jesus says, &quot;Do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own&quot; (Matthew 6:34).

If God is &quot;I AM&quot; (not &quot;I was&quot; or &quot;I will be&quot;), and tomorrow&#39;s grace will come tomorrow, what does that mean for this moment right now? Is this moment enough?
</li>
<li><strong>What does &quot;fixing your eyes on Jesus&quot; look like practically for you today?</strong>
Not wandering eyes that constantly look around at what might go wrong. Not backward eyes living in regret. Not anxious eyes straining to see the distant future. Fixed eyes. On Jesus. On this moment.

What does that actually look like in your life today? When you notice your mind wandering to past or future, what will you do to bring it back to this moment?
</li>

<h3>1. Become aware of God&#39;s presence</h3>

Take a few deep breaths.. Acknowledge that God is present with you right now..

<h3>2. Review the day with gratitude</h3>

Walk through your day from start to finish.. Notice where you saw God&#39;s presence..

<h3>3. Pay attention to your emotions</h3>

What moments stirred strong emotions—joy, anger, peace, anxiety?. Don&#39;t judge them..

<h3>4. Choose one feature of the day</h3>

Pick one moment that stands out.. Sit with it..

<h3>5. Look toward tomorrow</h3>

Not with anxiety, but with hope.. What&#39;s one thing you&#39;re facing tomorrow?.

<h2>Closing Image</h2>

You&#39;re standing at the edge of tomorrow, but you&#39;re not stepping into it yet. Not because you&#39;re afraid. But because you&#39;re learning the sacred art of being here. Now. In this moment.

The sun is setting on today. Tomorrow is still dark, still unknown. But this moment—this space between what was and what will be—is filled with light.

You can feel it. God&#39;s presence. Not in yesterday&#39;s memory. Not in tomorrow&#39;s promise. Here. Now. In this breath.

<h3>MOVEMENT 3: UNFORCED RHYTHMS (The Transformation)</h3>
<h3>Chapter 10: Deep Roots, Strong Growth</h3>
[audio src="https://www.skylerthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/I-Will-Trust-You-Lord.mp3"]
<p>You can spot the difference between a plant with deep roots and one with shallow roots from a single summer.</p>
<p>When drought comes, the shallow-rooted plant withers first. Its leaves yellow. Its stem weakens. It looks healthy enough when conditions are ideal, but it has no reserves. No depth. Nothing to draw from when surface water dries up.</p>
<p>The deep-rooted plant? It stays green. Not because it&#39;s stronger or trying harder.</p>
<p>Because its roots have gone deep enough to reach water others can&#39;t access.</p>
<p>This chapter is about spiritual depth. Not the flashy kind that impresses people. The hidden kind that sustains you when no one&#39;s watching. The kind that grows underground, unseen, unremarkable—but makes all the difference when the heat comes.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s what you&#39;re learning: rhythms are good, but rhythms without roots become rote. Practices are helpful, but practices without depth become performance.</p>
<p>You need more than sustainable patterns. You need deep foundations.</p>
<p>The question isn&#39;t just &quot;How do I walk in rhythm?&quot; It&#39;s &quot;How do I stay rooted when storms come? How do I keep from sliding back? How do I build a life that thrives, not just survives?&quot;</p>
<p>The answer is roots. Deep roots. The kind that reach down to streams of living water and anchor you when everything else shakes.</p>
<p>The writing that follows came from my discovery that spiritual disciplines aren&#39;t about trying harder.</p>
<p>They&#39;re about sending roots deeper. About staying connected to the Source in ways that transform you from the inside out.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Key Themes</h2>
<p><strong>1. The Work of Putting to Death</strong></p>
<p>There&#39;s a paradox at the heart of spiritual growth: before roots can go deep into what belongs, they have to let go of what doesn&#39;t.</p>
<p>Deep roots require putting to death:</p>
<p><strong>Pride</strong> - The need to be right. The compulsion to prove ourselves. The addiction to being seen, recognized, validated by others. Pride keeps our roots shallow because it keeps us focused on ourselves rather than God. We&#39;re constantly comparing, competing, defending, performing. All that energy goes into image management rather than transformation.</p>
<p>The antidote isn&#39;t self-hatred. It&#39;s what Paul calls in Philippians 2 &quot;considering others more significant than yourselves.&quot; The humility that says, &quot;I don&#39;t have to win this argument. I don&#39;t have to prove I&#39;m right. I can be wrong and still be loved.&quot;</p>
<p>Pride keeps you on the surface, performing. Humility sends roots deep, receiving.</p>
<p><strong>Reactivity</strong> - Responding from wounds instead of from identity. When someone criticizes you, do you react defensively? When life doesn&#39;t go your way, do you lash out? When you feel threatened, do you attack?</p>
<p>Reactivity is living from your False Self—the wounded, defended, self-protective version of you. Deep roots grow when you learn to respond from your True Self—the beloved, secure, grounded-in-God version of you.</p>
<p>This doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t feel pain. You do. But you don&#39;t let the pain control your response.</p>
<p>You feel it, name it, bring it to God, and then choose how to respond rather than simply reacting.</p>
<p><strong>Isolation</strong> - The temptation to withdraw when things get hard. To hide your struggles. To pretend you&#39;re fine when you&#39;re not. To go it alone because you&#39;re afraid of being a burden or being rejected.</p>
<p>Isolation is the enemy of deep roots. Trees don&#39;t grow in isolation—they grow in groves, forests, communities where their roots intertwine with other roots, creating stability and sharing nutrients.</p>
<p>You need community. Not performative community where everyone pretends to have it all together. Real community where you can be honest about your struggles, receive prayer, offer support, and grow together.</p>
<p>Deep roots require staying connected even when you want to withdraw.</p>
<p><strong>Bitterness</strong> - The nursing of perceived injustices. The rehearsal of how you&#39;ve been wronged. The keeping of records. The refusal to forgive.</p>
<p>Bitterness is like poison in the soil. It doesn&#39;t hurt the person you&#39;re bitter toward—it hurts you. It keeps your roots shallow and twisted, unable to reach the streams of living water because they&#39;re too busy clinging to old wounds.</p>
<p>Forgiveness doesn&#39;t mean what happened was okay. It means you&#39;re releasing it so it doesn&#39;t control you anymore.</p>
<p>You&#39;re letting go so your roots can grow deep into grace rather than staying tangled in grievance.</p>
<p>This is hard work. Dying work. But it&#39;s necessary work.</p>
<p>Because you can&#39;t grow deep roots in poisoned soil.</p>
<p><strong>2. The Work of Cultivating What Belongs</strong></p>
<p>Putting to death is only half the work. The other half is cultivating what belongs—the virtues, practices, and postures that create conditions for deep roots.</p>
<p><strong>Humility</strong> - Acknowledging your need for grace. Admitting you don&#39;t have it all together. Embracing your limits rather than pretending they don&#39;t exist.</p>
<p>Richard Foster writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Superficiality is the curse of our age. The doctrine of instant satisfaction is a primary spiritual problem. The desperate need today is not for a greater number of intelligent people, or gifted people, but for deep people.&quot;</p>
<p>— Richard Foster, <em>Celebration of Discipline</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Humility is the path to depth. Because humility says, &quot;I need help. I need God. I need community. I need grace.&quot; And that acknowledgment positions you to receive what you need.</p>
<p>Pride keeps you on the surface, performing. Humility sends roots deep, receiving.</p>
<p><strong>Responsiveness</strong> - Acting from your True Self, not your wounded self. Learning to pause between stimulus and response. Choosing how you&#39;ll act rather than simply reacting.</p>
<p>This requires self-awareness—knowing your triggers, understanding your patterns, recognizing when you&#39;re operating from wounds versus operating from belovedness.</p>
<p>And it requires spiritual practices—silence and solitude to hear God&#39;s voice, prayer to seek His guidance, Scripture to renew your mind, community to hold you accountable.</p>
<p>Deep roots make you responsive rather than reactive. Grounded rather than tossed about. Stable rather than volatile.</p>
<p><strong>Connection</strong> - Staying engaged even when vulnerable. Showing up even when it&#39;s hard. Choosing relationship over isolation.</p>
<p>John Ortberg writes about the importance of spiritual community in <em>Everybody&#39;s Normal Till You Get to Know Them</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Being in community is like being in a pool. It&#39;s easier to stay afloat when you&#39;re connected to others. Isolation is like trying to tread water alone—eventually, you sink.&quot;</p>
<p>— John Ortberg, adapted from <em>Everybody&#39;s Normal Till You Get to Know Them</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Connection doesn&#39;t mean perfect harmony all the time. It means staying at the table even when conversations are hard. Staying in the community even when you&#39;re disappointed. Staying in relationship even when you&#39;re hurting.</p>
<p>Because isolation is where roots shrivel. Connection is where they deepen.</p>
<p><strong>Forgiveness</strong> - Releasing what you can&#39;t control. Letting go of the need for justice, vindication, or revenge. Trusting God to make all things right in His time.</p>
<p>Forgiveness isn&#39;t a one-time decision. It&#39;s a daily practice. Sometimes an hourly practice. You choose to release the offense again and again until one day you realize it no longer has power over you.</p>
<p>This is the work of cultivating deep roots: putting to death what doesn&#39;t belong, cultivating what does. Not by addition, but by transformation.</p>
<p><strong>3. The Tree by Streams of Water</strong></p>
<p>The Psalmist paints a picture of flourishing that captures everything deep roots make possible:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Blessed is the one
    who does not walk in step with the wicked
or stand in the way that sinners take
    or sit in the company of mockers,
but whose delight is in the law of the LORD,
    and who meditates on his law day and night.
That person is like a tree planted by streams of water,
    which yields its fruit in season
and whose leaf does not wither—
    whatever they do prospers.&quot;</p>
<p>— Psalm 1:1-3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice the progression: The blessed person doesn&#39;t walk, stand, or sit with those who mock God. Instead, they delight in God&#39;s Word and meditate on it continually.</p>
<p>And the result? They&#39;re like a tree planted by streams of water.</p>
<p><strong>Planted, not drifting.</strong> Intentional, rooted, stable. Not a tumbleweed blown wherever the wind takes it. You&#39;ve been planted by streams—the water&#39;s edge of grace. Now roots are growing deep.</p>
<p><strong>Streams of water.</strong> The tree doesn&#39;t generate its own water. It&#39;s positioned by an abundant source. You don&#39;t generate your own grace. You&#39;re rooted in God&#39;s inexhaustible provision. The streams flow constantly. You access them through roots—prayer, Scripture, worship, community, Sabbath.</p>
<p><strong>Fruit in season.</strong> Not all the time. Not constantly. In season. This is realistic spirituality. There are seasons of growth, seasons of fruit, seasons of dormancy, seasons of pruning. Deep roots don&#39;t guarantee constant productivity. They guarantee sustainable fruitfulness over time.</p>
<p><strong>Leaf does not wither.</strong> Even in drought—hard seasons when surface moisture evaporates, when emotions are dry, when external supports fail—the deeply rooted tree endures. Why? Because deep roots access water others can&#39;t reach.</p>
<p>This is the stability deep roots offer: not exemption from hard seasons, but endurance through them.</p>
<p><strong>Whatever they do prospers.</strong> Not prosperity gospel—not &quot;follow these steps, get these results.&quot; This is organic flourishing. A well-rooted tree naturally prospers because it&#39;s connected to its source.</p>
<p>Stay rooted. The fruit will come. Not forced. Not manufactured. Organic. In season.</p>
<p><strong>4. The Promise of Jeremiah</strong></p>
<p>The prophet Jeremiah expands this imagery with even stronger promises:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;But blessed is the one who trusts in the LORD,
    whose confidence is in him.
They will be like a tree planted by the water
    that sends out its roots by the stream.
It does not fear when heat comes;
    its leaves are always green.
It has no worries in a year of drought
    and never fails to bear fruit.&quot;</p>
<p>— Jeremiah 17:7-8</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice the difference from Psalm 1: Jeremiah emphasizes trust and resilience. Deep roots come from trusting the LORD—not your performance, not your circumstances, but God.</p>
<p><strong>Trust as the foundation.</strong> Jeremiah contrasts two types of people: those who trust in humans (cursed, like a bush in parched desert) and those who trust in the LORD (blessed, like a tree by water). Your roots go where your trust is. If you trust yourself, roots stay shallow—limited by your capacity. If you trust God, roots go deep—accessing an infinite source.</p>
<p><strong>Sends out roots.</strong> Active imagery. You don&#39;t passively wait for depth. You actively cultivate it through practices, through choices, through sustained rhythms. But the growth itself is organic, not forced.</p>
<p><strong>Does not fear when heat comes.</strong> This is the promise: resilience. Heat—trials, suffering, hard seasons—will come. The question isn&#39;t if, but when. But deeply rooted trees don&#39;t fear the heat. Not because heat doesn&#39;t hurt, but because deep roots access water even when surface conditions are scorching.</p>
<p><strong>No worries in drought.</strong> Not &quot;no awareness&quot;—the tree knows there&#39;s drought. But &quot;no anxiety.&quot; It sees withering all around but has no worries because its roots reach deep water. This is the unforced rhythm of trust: acknowledging hard realities without anxious striving.</p>
<p><strong>Never fails to bear fruit.</strong> An even stronger promise than Psalm 1&#39;s &quot;fruit in season.&quot; Why? Because the tree is constantly connected to the stream. It&#39;s not dependent on rainfall (external circumstances). It&#39;s rooted by a stream (constant internal source).</p>
<p>When you&#39;re deeply rooted in God, you don&#39;t become fruitless in hard seasons. The fruit might look different—not abundance, but endurance; not productivity, but presence. But you never fail to bear it.</p>
<p><strong>5. Rooted and Built Up in Christ</strong></p>
<p>The apostle Paul gives practical instructions for how roots actually deepen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;So then, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live your lives in him, rooted and built up in him, strengthened in the faith as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness.&quot;</p>
<p>— Colossians 2:6-7</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the process: receive, continue, be rooted, be built up, be strengthened, overflow.</p>
<p><strong>As you received.</strong> Paul anchors growth in grace. You didn&#39;t earn salvation—you received it. Now live the same way. Don&#39;t shift from grace (how you were saved) to works (how you think you&#39;ll grow). Deep roots grow in the soil of grace, not striving.</p>
<p><strong>Continue to live in him.</strong> The word &quot;continue&quot; suggests consistency—the unforced rhythms of the previous chapter. Not a one-time decision. Ongoing, daily, rhythmic living in Christ. Roots deepen through sustained connection, not sporadic effort.</p>
<p><strong>Rooted and built up.</strong> Paul combines two metaphors: agricultural (rooted) and architectural (built up). Roots grow down—unseen, slow, deep. Buildings go up—visible, structured, intentional. Both are necessary. Deep roots provide stability for strong growth.</p>
<p><strong>Strengthened in faith.</strong> Faith deepens through practice, teaching, community. You were &quot;taught&quot;—you didn&#39;t discover this alone. Deep roots grow in community, with mentors, through Scripture, with accountability.</p>
<p><strong>Overflowing with thankfulness.</strong> The result of deep roots is overflow. Not scarcity—hoarding grace for yourself. But abundance—so rooted in God&#39;s love you overflow with gratitude. Thankfulness becomes the posture of the deeply rooted life.</p>
<p><strong>6. The Disciplines as Roots</strong></p>
<p>How do roots actually go deep? Through spiritual practices that position you in the stream of God&#39;s grace.</p>
<p>Jan Johnson writes about contemplative practices in <em>When the Soul Listens</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Spiritual disciplines are not tasks to check off a list. They are invitations to be with God. Prayer is not about saying the right words—it&#39;s about showing up. Scripture reading is not about covering chapters—it&#39;s about listening. Sabbath is not about rules—it&#39;s about rest. When we approach disciplines this way, they become life-giving rhythms rather than religious obligations.&quot;</p>
<p>— Jan Johnson, adapted from <em>When the Soul Listens</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The spiritual disciplines—prayer, study, fasting, solitude, service, worship, Sabbath—are how you send roots deep. Not to earn God&#39;s favor. But to position yourself where grace can transform you.</p>
<p><strong>Prayer</strong> - Not just asking for things, but cultivating awareness of God&#39;s presence. Learning to abide. To rest. To listen.</p>
<p><strong>Scripture</strong> - Not just accumulating knowledge, but letting the Word renew your mind, shape your desires, reorder your loves.</p>
<p><strong>Sabbath</strong> - Not just a day off, but a rhythm of rest that reminds you: you are not what you produce. You are beloved.</p>
<p><strong>Solitude</strong> - Not isolation, but intentional time alone with God. Away from noise, hurry, and distraction. Space to hear His voice.</p>
<p><strong>Community</strong> - Not performance, but authentic connection. Confession. Accountability. Mutual encouragement. Shared worship.</p>
<p><strong>Service</strong> - Not to earn approval, but to overflow from abundance. Giving from what you&#39;ve received. Loving because you&#39;ve been loved.</p>
<p>These aren&#39;t rules to keep or hoops to jump through. They&#39;re the practices that create conditions for deep roots. You can&#39;t force roots to grow. But you can position yourself by the stream and let growth happen.</p>
<p>Adele Ahlberg Calhoun writes in <em>Spiritual Disciplines Handbook</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We cannot transform ourselves. But we can cooperate with God&#39;s transforming work. Spiritual disciplines are the means by which we place ourselves in the path of God&#39;s grace. They are how we say yes to the Spirit&#39;s work in us.&quot;</p>
<p>— Adele Ahlberg Calhoun, <em>Spiritual Disciplines Handbook</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the work of deep roots: sustained, patient cooperation with God&#39;s grace. Not earning. Not striving. Positioning yourself. And trusting the growth to come.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Biblical Parallels</h2>
<p><strong>The Parable of the Sower (Matthew 13:1-23)</strong></p>
<p>Jesus tells a story about a farmer scattering seed. Some falls on the path and birds eat it. Some falls on rocky ground—it sprouts quickly but withers because it has no root. Some falls among thorns that choke it. And some falls on good soil and produces a crop—thirty, sixty, even a hundred times what was sown.</p>
<p>Jesus explains: The seed is the Word of God. The soils represent different responses.</p>
<p>The rocky ground is particularly relevant to this chapter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The seed falling on rocky ground refers to someone who hears the word and at once receives it with joy. But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.&quot;</p>
<p>— Matthew 13:20-21</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No root. That&#39;s the problem. Enthusiasm without depth. Emotion without foundation. The person receives the Word with joy—there&#39;s initial excitement, genuine response. But when heat comes, they wither. Why? No root.</p>
<p>This is the warning of Chapter 10: don&#39;t settle for surface-level faith. Don&#39;t mistake initial enthusiasm for deep transformation. Send roots deep now—through sustained practices, patient trust, consistent rhythms—so when heat comes (and it will), you don&#39;t wither.</p>
<p>The good soil represents those who &quot;hear the word, accept it, and produce a crop&quot; (Mark 4:20). But even good soil requires cultivation. Weeding. Watering. Tending. The disciplines are how you cultivate the soil of your soul so roots can go deep and fruit can come.</p>
<p><strong>The Vine and the Branches (John 15:1-8)</strong></p>
<p>Jesus uses agricultural imagery to describe the Christian life:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.&quot;</p>
<p>— John 15:5</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key word is &quot;remain&quot;—or in other translations, &quot;abide.&quot; This is the language of roots. Branches don&#39;t try to produce fruit. They remain connected to the vine. And fruit happens naturally.</p>
<p>You don&#39;t manufacture fruit through effort. You remain connected to Jesus through sustained practices of prayer, Scripture, worship, community. And fruit—love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control (Galatians 5:22-23)—grows organically.</p>
<p>But remaining requires intentionality. Branches can be cut off. They can be pruned. They can wither if they don&#39;t stay connected to the vine.</p>
<p>The unforced rhythms of grace aren&#39;t passive. They&#39;re active cooperation with God&#39;s life flowing into you. You position yourself. You remain. You abide. And the fruit comes.</p>
<p><strong>The Fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23)</strong></p>
<p>Paul contrasts the works of the flesh (what happens when you live from False Self, from striving, from performance) with the fruit of the Spirit (what happens when you live from True Self, from belovedness, from grace):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law.&quot;</p>
<p>— Galatians 5:22-23</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice: it&#39;s fruit, not works. Works are produced through effort. Fruit grows organically when you&#39;re connected to the source.</p>
<p>This is the promise of deep roots: not that you&#39;ll have to try harder to be loving, joyful, peaceful, patient. But that as you remain connected to Jesus—as your roots go deep into His love—these qualities will grow naturally.</p>
<p>Not overnight. Not all at once. But in season. Over time. Through the slow, organic work of roots reaching down to streams of living water.</p>
<p><strong>The Tree Planted by Water (Ezekiel 47:12)</strong></p>
<p>Ezekiel has a vision of water flowing from the temple, bringing life wherever it goes. And along the banks of this river:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Fruit trees of all kinds will grow on both banks of the river. Their leaves will not wither, nor will their fruit fail. Every month they will bear fruit, because the water from the sanctuary flows to them. Their fruit will serve for food and their leaves for healing.&quot;</p>
<p>— Ezekiel 47:12</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the eschatological vision—the ultimate flourishing. But it&#39;s also the pattern for now: trees planted by streams of living water, bearing fruit, leaves for healing.</p>
<p>The water from the sanctuary flows to them. You don&#39;t generate your own life. You&#39;re positioned by the stream of God&#39;s grace. And as that grace flows to you—through prayer, Scripture, worship, community, Sabbath—you bear fruit. Your life becomes food for others. Your presence brings healing.</p>
<p>This is what deep roots make possible.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Theological Anchor</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing. If you do not remain in me, you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned. If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. This is to my Father&#39;s glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples.&quot;</p>
<p>— John 15:5-8</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is Jesus&#39;s teaching on remaining—on abiding. And it&#39;s the theological foundation for everything this chapter teaches about deep roots.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;I am the vine; you are the branches.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>The relationship is organic, not mechanical. Not master and servant. Not employer and employee. Vine and branches. Living connection. Shared life. The sap that flows through the vine flows through the branches. The life that sustains the vine sustains the branches.</p>
<p>You&#39;re not disconnected from Jesus, trying to imitate Him from a distance. You&#39;re connected to Jesus, sharing His life.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>The condition is remaining. Not striving. Not performing. Not white-knuckling your way to holiness. Remaining. Abiding. Staying connected.</p>
<p>And the promise is fruit. Not because you&#39;re trying to produce it. But because life is flowing from the vine into the branches. The fruit is inevitable when the connection is sustained.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Apart from me you can do nothing.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>This is both humbling and liberating. Humbling because it reminds you: you&#39;re not the source. You can&#39;t generate spiritual life through your own effort. Liberating because it takes the pressure off. You don&#39;t have to produce. You just have to remain.</p>
<p>Eugene Peterson writes about this invitation in his translation of Matthew 11:28-30:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Are you tired? Worn out? Burned out on religion? Come to me. Get away with me and you&#39;ll recover your life. I&#39;ll show you how to take a real rest. Walk with me and work with me—watch how I do it. Learn the unforced rhythms of grace. I won&#39;t lay anything heavy or ill-fitting on you. Keep company with me and you&#39;ll learn to live freely and lightly.&quot;</p>
<p>— Matthew 11:28-30, The Message</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unforced rhythms. That&#39;s the key. Not forced striving. Not rigid rules. Not exhausting performance. Unforced—natural, sustainable, flowing. Rhythms—repeating patterns, not one-time efforts. Of grace—sourced in God&#39;s love, not your striving.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Remaining isn&#39;t just emotional closeness. It&#39;s also letting Jesus&#39;s words dwell in you. Meditating on Scripture. Letting it shape your thinking, reorder your desires, renew your mind.</p>
<p>As you remain and His words remain, your prayers change. You stop asking for what you want and start asking for what He wants. And those prayers are answered because they&#39;re aligned with His will.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;This is to my Father&#39;s glory, that you bear much fruit.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>The goal isn&#39;t your glory. It&#39;s the Father&#39;s. When you bear fruit—when love, joy, peace, patience, kindness grow in you—people see it and give glory to God. Not because you&#39;re amazing. Because God&#39;s grace is transforming you.</p>
<p>This is the theological anchor: remain in Jesus. Let His words remain in you. And fruit will come—not forced, but organic. Not manufactured, but received. Not through your effort, but through your abiding.</p>
<p>Deep roots make abiding possible. And abiding makes fruit inevitable.</p>

<h2>The Wayfarer Moment</h2>
<p><strong>Learning to trust the hidden work.</strong></p>
<p>For years, I equated spiritual growth with visible progress. I wanted to see results. Measure outcomes. Track my advancement. If I couldn&#39;t see it, I questioned whether anything was actually happening.</p>
<p>But roots don&#39;t work that way.</p>
<p>The most important growth happens underground. Unseen. Unmeasured. Unremarkable to anyone watching.</p>
<p>Above ground, a tree might look unchanged for months. But below ground, roots are spreading, reaching, deepening. And that hidden work is what makes everything else possible.</p>
<p>I learned this the hard way. After coming out of the swamp, after encountering grace at the water&#39;s edge, I wanted instant transformation. I wanted to be different immediately—healed, whole, bearing fruit.</p>
<p>But God was growing roots.</p>
<p>There were days when I felt like nothing was changing. I&#39;d pray and feel nothing. Read Scripture and feel unmoved. Gather with community and still feel alone.</p>
<p>But looking back now, I can see what was happening. Roots were going deep. Not dramatically. Not visibly. But steadily. Through sustained practices. Through showing up even when I didn&#39;t feel like it. Through choosing connection over isolation. Through releasing bitterness and cultivating forgiveness.</p>
<p>The wayfarer moment came when I stopped measuring my progress by what I could see and started trusting the hidden work God was doing.</p>
<p>I stopped asking, &quot;Why aren&#39;t I different yet?&quot; and started asking, &quot;Am I remaining in Him? Are my roots going deeper?&quot;</p>
<p>Because here&#39;s what I&#39;ve learned: surface-level change happens fast but doesn&#39;t last. Deep transformation happens slowly but endures.</p>
<p>You can manufacture behavior change through willpower. But it won&#39;t last. The first time stress hits, the first time temptation comes, you&#39;ll revert to old patterns.</p>
<p>But deep roots—roots that reach down to streams of living water—create lasting stability. Not perfection. But resilience. Not arrival. But endurance.</p>
<p>I still have hard days. Days when I&#39;m reactive instead of responsive. Days when I choose isolation over connection. Days when bitterness resurfaces and I have to forgive again.</p>
<p>But I don&#39;t panic anymore. Because I know: the roots are there. They&#39;re deep. And even when I can&#39;t see growth above ground, there&#39;s work happening below.</p>
<p>This is the invitation: trust the hidden work. Keep showing up. Keep practicing the disciplines. Keep remaining in Jesus. The fruit will come. In season. When roots are ready.</p>

<h2>Original Writing from the Blog</h2>
<p><strong>Psalm 1: Interpretation for Today&#39;s Life</strong></p>
<p>Blessed is the one who refuses to press the Easy button by following the ways of the wicked rather than taking the path of integrity and hard work</p>
<p>Blessed is the one who avoids temptations of the wicked, like…
…Cheating on my taxes by submitting false documentation and using the excuse &quot;The Government owes me this&quot;
…Short changing the cashier when I know I was given too much change in return, resulting in a shortage in their cash drawer to be reconciled and flippantly using the excuse &quot;That&#39;s their loss, my gain&quot;
…Taking credit for someone else&#39;s accomplishments to make me look better, rather than speaking the truth and giving credit where credit is due and using the excuse &quot;I did most of the work anyway and I deserve the credit&quot;
…Covering up my own mistakes by blaming someone else behind their back and using the excuse &quot;They never do anything worthwhile and this wasn&#39;t my fault&quot;
…Taking it out on another in fits of anger or other types of control and using the excuse &quot;They never help me out when I need it or give me a break; I&#39;m always bailing them out&quot;
…Not trusting you God with my brokenness and failures, and instead turning to addictive behaviors using the excuse &quot;I can solve my own problems; and, God wouldn&#39;t help me anyway&quot;
…Making myself out to be more important than you God, and thus committing the vilest of sin using the excuse &quot;Who are you God that I would trust you with my problems? You never answer my prayers. I&#39;ll fix it myself&quot;</p>
<p>Bless us Lord instead when we thirst for your Words of life and meditate on them day and night
Bless us when we sing praises and pray to you in our cars on the way to work or school or during our morning devotion
Bless us when we pray for others and when we lift them up to you on their behalf</p>
<p>Plant us and root us in your Words, like a tree next to a stream of water soaking up the deep waters of life
Let our leaves flourish and never wither
May our trunk grow strong to withstand life&#39;s storms and the never ending attacks of the wicked
May you prosper all of our activities…
…In our interactions with family and friends and our coworkers
…With every conversation we have with those as we go about our day that they may see You living within us
…When we are thankful and gracious to those around us and can see when someone needs encouragement in their day
…When we offer forgiveness to those who hurt us and when we are quick to say we are sorry when we hurt others
…When we do not pass up any opportunity to do a kind deed to the least of these among us</p>
<p>May we not be like paper rubbish blown hither and yonder in the wind like the wicked who have no direction or purpose but of themselves
May we not stand condemned in the judgement but remain strong in the assembly of the righteous
Watch over us, oh Lord, in our walk of righteousness
And keep us from the destructive ways of the wicked
For you are our God
Glory to God in the highest</p>
<p>Amen</p>

<h2>Song Integration</h2>
<p>This writing came from reflecting on Psalm 1 during a season when I was learning what it means to be rooted. To be planted, not drifting. To draw life from God&#39;s Word rather than from the world&#39;s shallow streams.</p>
<p>I was struck by the psalm&#39;s contrast: the wicked are like chaff—lightweight, blown about by wind, no substance. But the righteous are like trees—rooted, stable, fruitful.</p>
<p>I&#39;d spent too many years as chaff. Blown by others&#39; opinions. Shaped by cultural pressures. Reactive to circumstances. No roots. No stability. No depth.</p>
<p>But God was inviting me to something different. To be planted. To send roots deep into His Word, His love, His presence. To become the kind of person who could withstand storms because I was anchored in Him.</p>
<p>This interpretation of Psalm 1 was my way of wrestling with what that means practically. Not just theologically. Not just theoretically. But in the daily choices of life.</p>
<p>What does it look like to be rooted in God&#39;s Word when temptation comes? When shortcuts are available? When everyone else is cutting corners and I could too?</p>
<p>What does it look like to be a tree by streams of water when the culture around me is chaff—drifting, rootless, searching for meaning in all the wrong places?</p>
<p>The answer, I discovered, isn&#39;t trying harder to be good. It&#39;s staying rooted. Meditating on God&#39;s Word. Praying continually. Practicing presence. Choosing integrity even when no one&#39;s watching.</p>
<p>Because deep roots produce strong growth. Not overnight. But over time. In season. When the roots are ready.</p>
<h3>Song: &quot;I Will Trust You Lord&quot;</h3>
<p><strong>Verse 1:</strong>
I will trust You, Lord, my shelter, my song
Planted by Your stream, where my roots grow strong
When the heat is near, still my leaves stay bright
In the darkest storm, You will be my light</p>
<p><strong>Pre-Chorus:</strong>
Oh, my heart is grounded deep in Your grace
Anchored in Your presence, I will stand in faith</p>
<p><strong>Chorus:</strong>
Like a tree beside the river, I will stand so tall
Through the fire, through the season, You&#39;re my all in all
My leaves stay green, my soul stays strong
Your love sustains me all life long
I will bear Your fruit, Lord, make me new
I am deeply rooted in You</p>
<p><strong>Verse 2:</strong>
I will drink Your Word, let it fill my soul
Day and night I&#39;ll seek You, Lord, You make me whole
When the winds arise, I will not be swayed
For my roots run deep, I will not be afraid</p>
<p><strong>Pre-Chorus:</strong>
Oh, my heart is grounded deep in Your grace
Anchored in Your presence, I will stand in faith</p>
<p><strong>Chorus:</strong>
Like a tree beside the river, I will stand so tall
Through the fire, through the season, You&#39;re my all in all
My leaves stay green, my soul stays strong
Your love sustains me all life long

I am deeply rooted in You</p>
<p><strong>Bridge:</strong>
No fear in the drought (No fear, no fear!)
No doubt in the storm (No doubt, no doubt!)
Your love is my anchor (My heart is Yours!)
I&#39;ll trust You, Lord (Forevermore!)</p>
<p><strong>Final Chorus:</strong>
Like a tree beside the river, I will stand so tall
Through the fire, through the season, You&#39;re my all in all
My leaves stay green, my soul stays strong
Your love sustains me all life long
I will bear Your fruit, Lord, make me new
I am deeply rooted in You</p>
<p><strong>Outro:</strong>
Deeply rooted, never shaken
By Your love, I stand so strong
Deeply rooted, always faithful
In Your hands, I belong</p>

<h2>Reflections for the Road</h2>
<p>These aren&#39;t assignments to complete. They&#39;re invitations to deepen your roots.</p>
<p><strong>Questions for the Journey:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>What needs to die so roots can go deep?</strong></p>
<p>Look honestly at your life. Where is pride keeping you shallow? Where is reactivity preventing growth? Where is isolation cutting you off from community? Where is bitterness poisoning the soil?</p>
<p>Name it. Bring it to God. Ask for grace to let it die.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>What practices position you by the stream?</strong></p>
<p>What are the rhythms that connect you to God? Prayer? Scripture? Sabbath? Solitude? Worship? Community?</p>
<p>Are you practicing them consistently? Or sporadically? Deep roots require sustained connection, not occasional effort.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Where are you trying to manufacture fruit instead of remaining in the vine?</strong></p>
<p>Are you striving to be more loving? Trying harder to be joyful? White-knuckling your way to peace?</p>
<p>Fruit doesn&#39;t come from trying harder. It comes from remaining in Jesus. Are you abiding? Or are you achieving?</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>What does &quot;fruit in season&quot; mean for you right now?</strong></p>
<p>Not every season is fruitful. Some seasons are for growth. Some for pruning. Some for rest. Some for harvest.</p>
<p>What season are you in? Can you trust that God is at work even if you don&#39;t see visible fruit right now?</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Read Psalm 1 and Jeremiah 17:7-8 slowly. What is God saying to you through these images?</strong></p>
<p>Don&#39;t rush. Meditate. Let the imagery sink in. What does it look like for you to be a tree planted by streams of water?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2>Practice: Cultivating Deep Roots</h2>
<p>Here&#39;s a simple framework for sending roots deep through spiritual disciplines:</p>
<p><strong>1. Daily: Drink from the stream</strong></p>
<p>Choose one practice that connects you to God daily:</p>
<ul>
<li>Morning prayer and Scripture reading</li>
<li>Lectio divina (prayerful Scripture meditation)</li>
<li>Journaling prayers</li>
<li>Listening prayer in silence</li>
</ul>
<p>The practice matters less than the consistency. You&#39;re training your roots to reach for the stream every day.</p>
<p><strong>2. Weekly: Sabbath rest</strong></p>
<p>Set aside one day (or even a few hours) each week for Sabbath. Not as legalism. As gift.</p>
<p>Sabbath isn&#39;t about what you stop doing. It&#39;s about what you start receiving. Stop striving so you can receive rest. Stop producing so you can receive belovedness. Stop proving so you can receive grace.</p>
<p>Ruth Haley Barton writes in <em>Sacred Rhythms</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Sabbath is the most countercultural practice available to us. It is a fundamental way of expressing trust in God&#39;s provision. When we cease our labors, we acknowledge that God is the provider, not us.&quot;</p>
<p>— Ruth Haley Barton, <em>Sacred Rhythms</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>3. Monthly: Solitude and silence</strong></p>
<p>Once a month, create extended space for solitude. A few hours. A half day. A full day if possible.</p>
<p>Not just quiet time. Solitude—intentional time alone with God. Away from noise, hurry, screens, people.</p>
<p>What do you do in solitude? Nothing. And everything. You listen. You rest. You let God search your heart. You pay attention to what&#39;s happening in your soul.</p>
<p><strong>4. Seasonally: Examine your roots</strong></p>
<p>Every few months, review: Are my roots going deeper? Or am I staying shallow?</p>
<p>Ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Am I more reactive or more responsive than I was six months ago?</li>
<li>Am I more isolated or more connected?</li>
<li>Am I more bitter or more forgiving?</li>
<li>Am I more prideful or more humble?</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn&#39;t about shame. It&#39;s about awareness. Where do roots need to go deeper? What needs to die? What needs to be cultivated?</p>
<p><strong>5. Community: Grow in groves</strong></p>
<p>Trees don&#39;t grow in isolation. Their roots intertwine with other roots, creating stability and sharing nutrients.</p>
<p>You need community. Real community. Not performative. Not surface-level. But authentic connection where you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Confess struggles</li>
<li>Receive prayer</li>
<li>Offer encouragement</li>
<li>Practice forgiveness</li>
<li>Serve together</li>
<li>Worship together</li>
</ul>
<p>Who are your people? Who knows your real struggles? Who prays for you by name? Who holds you accountable with grace?</p>
<p>Deep roots grow in community.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Closing Image</h2>
<p>You&#39;re standing at the base of an ancient tree. Massive. Towering. Its canopy spreads wide, providing shade for acres.</p>
<p>How long has this tree been here? A hundred years? Two hundred? More?</p>
<p>You walk closer and place your hand on the trunk. Solid. Rough. Weathered by countless storms. Scarred by lightning strikes. Marked by seasons of growth and seasons of pruning.</p>
<p>But still standing.</p>
<p>You look up into the branches. Birds nest there. Squirrels scamper. Life thrives in the shelter this tree provides.</p>
<p>And then you look down. At the base. Where roots disappear into the earth.</p>
<p>You can&#39;t see them. But you know they&#39;re there. Reaching deep. Spreading wide. Anchoring this massive tree so firmly that no storm can topple it.</p>
<p>The roots are why the tree stands.</p>
<p>Not the visible trunk. Not the impressive canopy. Not the beautiful fruit.</p>
<p>The roots.</p>
<p>Hidden. Unseen. Unremarkable to anyone walking by.</p>
<p>But essential.</p>
<p>This is the invitation: send your roots deep. Not for show. Not for applause. Not even for immediate fruit.</p>
<p>For stability. For resilience. For sustainable life.</p>
<p>The work happens underground. In the quiet. In the daily practices. In the sustained rhythms. In the patient trust.</p>
<p>You won&#39;t always see results. You won&#39;t always feel growth. You won&#39;t always sense progress.</p>
<p>But if you remain—if you keep showing up, keep practicing the disciplines, keep choosing connection over isolation, keep releasing bitterness and cultivating forgiveness—the roots will go deep.</p>
<p>And when heat comes (and it will come), you won&#39;t fear.</p>
<p>When drought arrives (and it will arrive), you won&#39;t worry.</p>
<p>When storms rage (and they will rage), you won&#39;t be uprooted.</p>
<p>Because your roots—hidden, deep, sustained by streams of living water—will hold.</p>
<p>And in season, when roots are ready, fruit will come.</p>
<p>Not forced. Not manufactured. Not through exhausting effort.</p>
<p>Organic. Natural. Inevitable.</p>
<p>Because you remained. You abided. You sent roots deep.</p>
<p>Like a tree planted by streams of water.</p>
<p>Leaves green. Fruit in season. Soul strong.</p>
<p>Deeply rooted in the love of God.</p>
<p>And that makes all the difference.</p>

<h3>MOVEMENT 3: UNFORCED RHYTHMS (The Transformation)</h3>

<h3>Chapter 11: Redemption&#39;s Story</h3>

[audio src="https://www.skylerthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Redemption-Story.mp3"]
You&#39;ve been reading your story as if it&#39;s self-contained. Your swamp. Your rescue. Your journey. And while those details are uniquely yours, the pattern isn&#39;t.

The arc you&#39;re walking—from brokenness to redemption, from death to life, from exile to homecoming—isn&#39;t new. It&#39;s ancient. Older than your grandparents. Older than civilization. Older than the stars.

This is the pattern woven through all of history: creation, fall, redemption, restoration.

Eden lost and paradise regained. Exile and return. Death and resurrection.

Here&#39;s what changes everything: your story isn&#39;t separate from that larger story. It&#39;s part of it. A thread in the tapestry. A verse in the song.

A particular expression of THE redemption story that&#39;s been unfolding since before time began.

When you grasp this—when you really see your story within God&#39;s story—everything shifts. The pain has purpose. The waiting has meaning. The struggle isn&#39;t random.

Because you&#39;re not just surviving your circumstances. You&#39;re participating in the grand narrative of redemption that gives meaning to all of creation.

This chapter is about seeing the bigger picture. Understanding how your personal story fits into God&#39;s cosmic story.

Discovering that the God who promised redemption in Eden, who delivered Israel from Egypt, who raised Jesus from the dead, is the same God writing your story right now.

You&#39;re not the author. But you&#39;re not a footnote either.

You&#39;re a beloved character in the greatest story ever told—the story of how God redeems everything.

<h2>Key Themes</h2>

<strong>1. The Gospel as THE Story</strong>

Christianity isn&#39;t one religious option among many. It&#39;s THE story—the metanarrative that makes sense of all other stories. The framework within which human history unfolds. The lens through which we understand who we are, why we&#39;re here, what went wrong, and how it&#39;s being made right.

N.T. Wright writes in <em>Simply Christian</em>:

<blockquote>
&quot;The story of Jesus isn&#39;t one religious tale among many. It&#39;s the story the whole world has been waiting for. It&#39;s the story of how the Creator God became human to rescue His creation, to defeat evil, to launch His new creation project. When you grasp this story, you see everything differently.&quot;

— N.T. Wright, <em>Simply Christian</em>
</blockquote>

The redemption story has a clear arc:

<strong>Creation</strong> - God makes everything good. Humanity is created in His image, designed for relationship with Him, given purpose and dignity and calling.

<strong>Fall</strong> - Sin enters through human rebellion. The image is marred. Relationship is broken. Creation is cursed. Death enters the world. Humanity is exiled from Eden.

<strong>Redemption</strong> - God doesn&#39;t abandon His creation. He promises a Savior. He calls a people. He gives the Law to reveal sin and point to grace. He sends prophets to declare His faithfulness. And then—in the fullness of time—He sends His Son. Jesus, the eternal Word, becomes flesh. Lives the perfect life we couldn&#39;t live. Dies the death we deserved. Rises victorious over sin and death. Accomplishes redemption.

<strong>Restoration</strong> - The story isn&#39;t finished. Jesus ascended but promised to return. He&#39;s building His Church. He&#39;s reconciling all things to Himself. And one day—the day we&#39;re waiting for—He will return to judge the living and the dead, to make all things new, to restore creation to what it was always meant to be. No more curse. No more tears. No more death. The New Jerusalem descending. God dwelling with His people forever.

This is THE story. Every other story—every myth, every legend, every fairy tale, every personal narrative—echoes this one. Because this is the true story of the world.

And you&#39;re in it.

<strong>2. Your Story Within God&#39;s Story</strong>

Your personal narrative isn&#39;t separate from God&#39;s narrative. It&#39;s woven into it. Your redemption story is a particular expression of THE redemption story.

When you were in the swamp, you weren&#39;t just struggling with personal sin. You were experiencing the effects of the fall—the brokenness that entered creation when humanity rebelled against God.

When you cried out for help, you weren&#39;t just praying for relief. You were participating in the pattern of human cry and divine response that runs throughout Scripture. From Adam and Eve hiding in the garden to the Israelites groaning in Egypt to David fleeing from Saul to Jonah in the fish to the tax collector beating his breast—God hears the cry of His people and responds with redemption.

When you encountered grace at the water&#39;s edge, you weren&#39;t just having a personal religious experience. You were meeting the same God who appeared to Moses in the burning bush, who led Israel through the Red Sea, who sent His Son to seek and save the lost.

When you died to self and rose in new life, you weren&#39;t just turning over a new leaf. You were participating in the death and resurrection of Jesus. United with Him in His death. Raised with Him in His resurrection. A new creation. The old has gone, the new has come.

Lesslie Newbigin writes in <em>The Gospel in a Pluralist Society</em>:

<blockquote>
&quot;To be converted is not to turn from one religion to another. It&#39;s to be brought into the true story of the world. To discover that your life has meaning because it&#39;s part of God&#39;s great redemption project.&quot;

— Lesslie Newbigin, <em>The Gospel in a Pluralist Society</em>
</blockquote>

Your story matters because it&#39;s part of God&#39;s story. The specifics are yours—your swamp is different from mine, your water&#39;s edge encounter is unique, your rhythms and roots look different than anyone else&#39;s. But the pattern is universal. The arc is the same. The Author is writing both your story and the cosmic story, and they fit together perfectly.

<strong>3. Nothing Wasted</strong>

One of the most powerful promises in the redemption story is this: nothing is wasted. Every pain, every struggle, every broken place, every hard season—God is weaving it all into the tapestry of redemption.

Romans 8:28 captures this promise:

<blockquote>
&quot;And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.&quot;
</blockquote>

Notice: Paul doesn&#39;t say all things are good. They&#39;re not. Sin is evil. Suffering is real. Brokenness hurts.

But he does say God works in all things for good. He&#39;s taking even the broken pieces—especially the broken pieces—and weaving them into a story of redemption.

Joseph&#39;s story is the perfect illustration. Betrayed by his brothers. Sold into slavery. Falsely accused. Imprisoned. Forgotten.

But God was at work the whole time. And when Joseph finally sees the bigger story—when he&#39;s reunited with his brothers—he can say:

<blockquote>
&quot;You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives.&quot;

— Genesis 50:20
</blockquote>

You intended harm. God intended good. Not that God caused the harm. But that He redeemed it. He took what was meant for destruction and turned it into salvation.

This is the promise for you: the years you spent in the swamp aren&#39;t wasted. God is redeeming them. The pain you experienced isn&#39;t meaningless. God is using it. The struggles that nearly broke you are being transformed into testimonies that will strengthen others.

Fleming Rutledge writes in <em>The Crucifixion</em>:

<blockquote>
&quot;The cross is God&#39;s answer to the problem of evil. Not that He explains it. But that He enters into it, bears it, transforms it. At the cross, the worst thing that ever happened—the murder of the Son of God—becomes the best thing that ever happened—the redemption of the world. If God can redeem that, He can redeem anything.&quot;

— Fleming Rutledge, <em>The Crucifixion</em>
</blockquote>

Nothing is wasted. Not in God&#39;s economy. He&#39;s the master of turning crucifixions into resurrections, tombs into triumphs, endings into new beginnings.

<strong>4. The Redemption Arc From Creation Through Consummation</strong>

The redemption story isn&#39;t just a moment—Jesus dying on the cross. It&#39;s an arc. A trajectory. A movement from creation through fall through redemption toward restoration.

And you&#39;re living in the middle of that arc.

<strong>Creation</strong> - You were made in God&#39;s image. Before you ever sinned, before you ever fell, you had dignity and worth and purpose because you were created by God, for God, to reflect God.

<strong>Fall</strong> - Sin marred that image. Your swamp—whatever form it took—was a manifestation of the fall. The brokenness in you, around you, because of you. The curse. The exile from Eden.

<strong>Redemption</strong> - Jesus came to rescue you. Not just your soul, but all of you. He didn&#39;t die to take you out of this world but to redeem you in it. To make you a new creation. To begin the work of restoration.

<strong>Restoration</strong> - This is where you are now. Living between &quot;already&quot; and &quot;not yet.&quot; Already redeemed. Not yet fully restored. The redemption is secured but the restoration is ongoing. You&#39;re being transformed from glory to glory. Growing in grace. Becoming more like Jesus. The roots are deepening. The fruit is coming. But it&#39;s not finished yet.

<strong>Consummation</strong> - One day, Jesus will return. And everything broken will be made whole. Every tear will be wiped away. Every wrong will be made right. No more swamps. No more struggle. Full restoration. Complete redemption. You&#39;ll stand before Him—fully redeemed, completely restored—and you&#39;ll spend eternity in unbroken fellowship with the God who created you, pursued you, redeemed you, and restored you.

Michael Gorman writes in <em>Becoming the Gospel</em>:

<blockquote>
&quot;The gospel isn&#39;t just about how to go to heaven when you die. It&#39;s about how heaven comes to earth through Jesus and His people. It&#39;s about God&#39;s project to restore all of creation—starting with you.&quot;

— Michael Gorman, <em>Becoming the Gospel</em>
</blockquote>

You&#39;re part of that project. Not as a passive recipient. As an active participant. God is restoring you so you can participate in His work of restoring the world.

<strong>5. Joseph, Peter, Paul: Examples of Redemption</strong>

The Bible is full of stories that illustrate the redemption arc. Let&#39;s look at three:

<strong>Joseph: From Pit to Palace</strong>

Joseph&#39;s story is betrayal to blessing. His brothers throw him in a pit, sell him into slavery. He&#39;s falsely accused, imprisoned, forgotten.

But God is at work. Joseph rises to become second-in-command in Egypt. When famine comes, he&#39;s positioned to save his entire family—the same brothers who betrayed him.

And when they&#39;re finally reconciled, Joseph can see the redemption arc:

<blockquote>
&quot;You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good.&quot;
</blockquote>

The pit wasn&#39;t wasted. The prison wasn&#39;t meaningless. God was positioning Joseph for purpose. Redeeming the broken pieces into a story of salvation.

<strong>Peter: From Denial to Boldness</strong>

Peter&#39;s story is failure to faithfulness. He swears he&#39;ll never deny Jesus. Then denies Him three times. The rooster crows. Peter weeps bitterly.

But Jesus doesn&#39;t write Peter off. After the resurrection, Jesus seeks Peter out. Three denials, three affirmations: &quot;Do you love me? Feed my sheep.&quot;

Restoration. Redemption. Recommissioning.

And the Peter who denied Jesus becomes the Peter who preaches at Pentecost. Bold. Courageous. Faithful unto death. His failure wasn&#39;t the end of his story. It was the beginning of his redemption arc.

<strong>Paul: From Persecutor to Apostle</strong>

Paul&#39;s story is violence to mission. He&#39;s breathing threats against Christians. Dragging them to prison. Approving Stephen&#39;s murder.

But Jesus meets him on the Damascus road. Blinds him. Calls him. Transforms him.

And the persecutor becomes the apostle. The one who tried to destroy the church becomes the one who builds it across the Roman Empire. The murderer becomes the missionary.

Paul never forgets his past. But he sees it redeemed:

<blockquote>
&quot;I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man... But I was shown mercy... so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display his immense patience as an example for those who would believe.&quot;

— 1 Timothy 1:13-16
</blockquote>

His worst moments become testimonies to God&#39;s greatest grace. Nothing wasted.

Scot McKnight writes in <em>The King Jesus Gospel</em>:

<blockquote>
&quot;The gospel isn&#39;t just a message to be believed. It&#39;s a story to be entered. When you hear these redemption stories—Joseph, Peter, Paul—you&#39;re not just reading about them. You&#39;re seeing the pattern of your own story. Betrayal redeemed. Failure restored. Violence transformed. This is what God does.&quot;

— Scot McKnight, <em>The King Jesus Gospel</em>
</blockquote>

<strong>6. Living as Part of the Larger Story</strong>

When you grasp that your story is part of God&#39;s story, it changes how you live.

<strong>You live with purpose.</strong> Your life isn&#39;t random. You&#39;re not wandering aimlessly. You&#39;re part of God&#39;s redemption project. Every choice matters. Every day has meaning. You&#39;re being formed for eternity.

<strong>You live with hope.</strong> No matter how hard today is, you know the ending. The story doesn&#39;t end with suffering. It ends with restoration. Jesus returns. All things are made new. The tears are wiped away. The curse is removed. You live in light of that promised future.

<strong>You live with perseverance.</strong> The struggles you face aren&#39;t meaningless. They&#39;re part of the redemption arc. God is using them to shape you, refine you, prepare you for the role you&#39;ll play in His kingdom. So you don&#39;t give up. You keep going. Because you know the Author is still writing.

<strong>You live with mission.</strong> You&#39;re not just receiving redemption. You&#39;re participating in it. God redeems you so you can be part of His redemptive work in the world. You bring light into dark places. Hope into despair. Grace into brokenness. You&#39;re an ambassador of the redemption story.

<strong>You live with gratitude.</strong> When you see the whole arc—creation, fall, redemption, restoration, consummation—you&#39;re overwhelmed by grace. You didn&#39;t earn this. You didn&#39;t deserve it. But God, in His great love, wrote you into His story. Pursued you in the swamp. Met you at the water&#39;s edge. Raised you to new life. And He&#39;s not done yet.

This is redemption&#39;s story. And it&#39;s your story too.

<h2>Biblical Parallels</h2>

<strong>The Redemption Promise in Eden (Genesis 3:15)</strong>

The moment sin enters the world, God speaks a promise of redemption:

<blockquote>
&quot;And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel.&quot;

— Genesis 3:15
</blockquote>

This is the first gospel proclamation—the <em>protoevangelium</em>. Even as God pronounces the curse, He promises redemption. A seed of the woman will come who will crush the serpent&#39;s head.

The entire Old Testament is the unfolding of this promise. Through Abraham, through Isaac, through Jacob, through David—the line is preserved. The promise is passed down. Until finally, in the fullness of time, the Seed comes: Jesus, born of a woman, who crushes the serpent&#39;s head at the cross.

Redemption wasn&#39;t an afterthought. It was promised from the beginning.

<strong>God&#39;s Plan to Unite All Things (Ephesians 1:9-10)</strong>

Paul reveals the scope of God&#39;s redemption plan:

<blockquote>
&quot;He made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in Christ, to be put into effect when the times reach their fulfillment—to bring unity to all things in heaven and on earth under Christ.&quot;

— Ephesians 1:9-10
</blockquote>

God&#39;s plan isn&#39;t just to save individual souls. It&#39;s to unite ALL things under Christ. Heaven and earth. Spiritual and physical. Every tribe, tongue, and nation. All of creation groaning for redemption will be restored.

This is the cosmic scope of the redemption story. Nothing left out. Nothing excluded. All things brought under Christ&#39;s lordship. All things made new.

<strong>New Creation (2 Corinthians 5:17)</strong>

Paul describes what happens when you enter the redemption story:

<blockquote>
&quot;Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!&quot;

— 2 Corinthians 5:17
</blockquote>

You&#39;re not just reformed. You&#39;re re-created. Not just improved. Made new. This is the redemption arc applied to individual lives: what was dead is brought to life. What was broken is made whole. What was enslaved is set free.

New creation doesn&#39;t mean perfection yet. But it means the redemption process has begun. You&#39;re being transformed. The old patterns are losing their power. The new life is growing. And one day, the new creation will be complete.

<strong>Behold, I Am Making All Things New (Revelation 21:5)</strong>

The redemption story reaches its climax in Revelation:

<blockquote>
&quot;He who was seated on the throne said, &#39;I am making everything new!&#39; Then he said, &#39;Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.&#39;&quot;

— Revelation 21:5
</blockquote>

Notice the tense: &quot;I AM making.&quot; Not &quot;I will make.&quot; Not &quot;I made.&quot; Present progressive. God is actively, right now, in the process of making all things new.

You&#39;re living in the &quot;making new&quot; phase. The restoration has begun but isn&#39;t finished. The kingdom has been inaugurated but not yet consummated. Jesus has won the victory but hasn&#39;t yet returned to fully implement it.

But He will. And when He does, the redemption story will be complete. New heaven. New earth. No more tears. No more death. All things made new.

This is the promise that gives hope to every wayfarer still walking through the wilderness: the story ends with restoration. Complete. Total. Eternal. Redemption.

<h2>Theological Anchor</h2>

<blockquote>
&quot;And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters. And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified.&quot;

— Romans 8:28-30
</blockquote>

This is the redemption arc applied to individual lives. Let&#39;s unpack it:

<strong>&quot;In all things God works for the good&quot;</strong>

Not some things. All things. Not just the good experiences. All experiences. God is at work in the swamp and at the water&#39;s edge, in the dying and in the rising, in the valleys and on the mountains.

This doesn&#39;t mean all things are good. They&#39;re not. Sin is evil. Suffering is real. Brokenness hurts.

But it does mean God is working in all things. Taking even the broken pieces and weaving them into a story of redemption. Nothing is outside His reach. Nothing is beyond His ability to redeem.

<strong>&quot;For the good of those who love him&quot;</strong>

The promise is conditional. Not universally applied. It&#39;s for those who love God—who are in relationship with Him, who trust Him, who have responded to His call.

If you&#39;re outside the redemption story, this promise doesn&#39;t apply. But if you&#39;ve entered it—if you&#39;ve responded to God&#39;s call, trusted in Jesus, been brought into the family—then this promise is yours.

God is working all things for your good. Not for your comfort. Not for your ease. But for your ultimate good—conformity to Christ, participation in His kingdom, eternal glory with Him.

<strong>&quot;Who have been called according to his purpose&quot;</strong>

You didn&#39;t stumble into the redemption story by accident. You were called. God pursued you. Drew you. Opened your eyes to see your need and His provision.

This calling has a purpose: not just your salvation but your participation in God&#39;s redemptive work. You&#39;re called to be conformed to Christ&#39;s image, to be salt and light in the world, to participate in the restoration of all things.

<strong>&quot;Predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son&quot;</strong>

Here&#39;s the goal: conformity to Jesus. Not perfection in this life. But progressive transformation until, one day, you&#39;re fully like Him.

This is what the redemption story accomplishes in you. You were created in God&#39;s image. Sin marred that image. Jesus came to restore it. And through the Spirit&#39;s work—in the rhythms of grace, through deep roots, in community and Scripture and prayer—you&#39;re being transformed into His likeness.

<strong>&quot;Called... justified... glorified&quot;</strong>

Paul traces the redemption arc in three movements:

<strong>Called</strong> - God pursued you. Spoke to you. Drew you to Himself. Your &quot;yes&quot; wasn&#39;t the beginning—God&#39;s call was.

<strong>Justified</strong> - You were declared righteous. Not because you earned it. But because Jesus&#39; righteousness was credited to you. You stand before God forgiven, accepted, beloved—not based on your performance but on Christ&#39;s finished work.

<strong>Glorified</strong> - Past tense. Even though it&#39;s future. Why? Because in God&#39;s eternal perspective, it&#39;s already done. The story is written. The ending is secure. You will be glorified—fully redeemed, completely restored, eternally with Christ.

This is the theological anchor: your redemption is part of God&#39;s eternal purpose. He foreknew you. Predestined you. Called you. Justified you. And He will glorify you.

The story isn&#39;t in doubt. The ending is secure. You&#39;re part of THE redemption story, and nothing can separate you from that.

<h2>The Wayfarer Moment</h2>

<strong>Seeing my story in THE story.</strong>

For years, I thought my story was just mine. My struggles. My failures. My small attempts to get it right. I&#39;d read the Bible as ancient history—good for principles, maybe, but not personally connected to my everyday life.

But then I started to see it.

The pattern of my life—swamp, water&#39;s edge, dying, rising, rhythms, roots—wasn&#39;t unique to me. It was the redemption arc. The same arc that runs through Scripture from Genesis to Revelation. From Eden to the New Jerusalem.

I wasn&#39;t just struggling with personal sin. I was experiencing the fall.

I wasn&#39;t just crying out for help. I was participating in the pattern of cry and divine response that echoes through the Psalms.

I wasn&#39;t just encountering grace. I was meeting the same God who met Moses, David, Peter, Paul.

I wasn&#39;t just dying to self. I was being united with Christ in His death and resurrection.

My story was part of THE story.

And when I saw that—really saw it—everything changed.

The pain I&#39;d experienced wasn&#39;t meaningless. It was part of the redemption arc. God was using it to conform me to Christ&#39;s image, to prepare me for the role I&#39;d play in His kingdom.

The waiting seasons weren&#39;t wasted. They were necessary parts of the story. Times of preparation. Seasons of root-deepening. Wilderness experiences that would later become testimonies.

The failures I&#39;d carried with shame weren&#39;t the end of my story. They were chapters in a larger redemption narrative. Like Peter&#39;s denial. Like Paul&#39;s persecution. Like Joseph&#39;s pit. God was redeeming them, transforming them into testimonies of grace.

The wayfarer moment came when I stopped seeing my life as disconnected events and started seeing it as a coherent narrative—my story woven into God&#39;s story.

I&#39;m not the author. I&#39;m a character. But I&#39;m a beloved character in a story written by a good Author who knows how to turn crucifixions into resurrections.

I don&#39;t know how my particular story will unfold. I don&#39;t know what chapters are ahead. But I know the Author. I know the arc. I know the ending.

Creation. Fall. Redemption. Restoration. Consummation.

And I know that in all things—ALL things—God is working for good. Nothing is wasted. Every pain has purpose. Every struggle is part of the redemption arc.

This is THE story. And by grace, it&#39;s my story too.

<h2>Original Writing from the Blog</h2>

<em>Note: The song &quot;Redemption Story&quot; serves as both the original writing and the song for this chapter, telling the complete gospel narrative from creation through consummation.</em>

<hr>

<h2>Song Integration</h2>

<strong>The Season of Fragmentation:</strong>

For years, my life felt like disconnected pieces. Random events. Unrelated struggles. Pain here, joy there, failure in one season, growth in another—but no coherent thread tying it all together.

I looked at my story and saw chaos. Mistakes I couldn&#39;t undo. Seasons that felt wasted. Suffering that seemed meaningless. I was drowning in the particulars of my own narrative, unable to see any pattern or purpose.

Questions haunted me: <em>Why did that relationship fail? Why did I waste those years in the swamp? Why did God allow that betrayal? What was the point of all that pain?</em>

I was so focused on my own story—my struggles, my failures, my journey—that I&#39;d lost sight of THE story. The grand narrative of redemption that&#39;s been unfolding since before the foundation of the world.

<strong>The Shift:</strong>

The turning point came during a season of deep study. Several authors helped me see the Bible not as a collection of disconnected morality tales, but as one coherent story with a single redemption arc.

Creation → Fall → Israel → Incarnation → Cross &amp; Resurrection → Church → Consummation.

And slowly—painfully slowly—I began to see: my story wasn&#39;t random. It was part of THE story.

The pain I&#39;d experienced? Part of the redemption arc—God conforming me to Christ&#39;s image through suffering.

The waiting seasons? Not wasted, but necessary. Wilderness experiences preparing me for what was ahead.

The failures? Like Peter&#39;s denial. Like Paul&#39;s persecution. Like Joseph&#39;s pit. God was redeeming them, weaving them into a larger narrative of grace.

Romans 8:28 clicked in a new way: &quot;All things work together for good for those who love God and are called according to His purpose.&quot; Not all things are good. But all things—even the painful, broken, seemingly wasted things—are being worked together into a redemptive purpose.

<strong>What This Song Does:</strong>

This song is my attempt to tell THE story. Not just the cross (though the cross is central). The <em>whole</em> story. From creation through consummation. The full redemption arc.

Because the gospel isn&#39;t just a moment—Jesus dying for my sins. It&#39;s a story. THE story. The story that makes sense of all other stories.

I wanted to trace redemption history chronologically:

<ul>
<li><strong>Creation</strong> (before the stars): God speaks, and everything comes to be. We&#39;re made in His image. Designed for relationship.</li>
<li><strong>The Fall</strong> (Eden&#39;s garden): The serpent&#39;s lie. Sin enters. Yet even then, a Savior is promised.</li>
<li><strong>The Prophecies</strong> (kings and prophets): David&#39;s line. Isaiah&#39;s suffering servant. God&#39;s faithfulness across centuries.</li>
<li><strong>The Incarnation</strong> (Mary&#39;s baby boy): The Word becomes flesh. Divinity wrapped in humanity.</li>
<li><strong>The Crucifixion</strong> (betrayal, denial, cross): Leaders scheme. Friends betray. Yet grace triumphs. Death is undone.</li>
<li><strong>Personal Application</strong> (to die with Christ): My story entwined with His. What was broken is being redeemed.</li>
<li><strong>Eternal Hope</strong> (forever His own): One day we&#39;ll stand before His throne. Forever redeemed.</li>
</ul>

And when you see your story within that larger story, everything changes.

<strong>Why This Song is Both Writing and Response:</strong>

For this chapter, there is no separate devotional. The song itself is the writing. The proclamation. The declaration.

Because sometimes, the most powerful response to a fragmented life is to tell THE story—to trace the redemption arc from beginning to end and recognize: <em>I&#39;m in this story. My pain, my waiting, my failures—they&#39;re being woven into this grand narrative of redemption.</em>

The song doesn&#39;t answer all my questions. It doesn&#39;t explain why specific things happened. But it does something more important: it locates my story within God&#39;s story.

And that reframing—from &quot;why did this happen to me?&quot; to &quot;how does this fit into God&#39;s redemption arc?&quot;—is transformative.

Where my life felt chaotic, THE story reveals purpose.
Where my pain felt meaningless, THE story reveals redemption.
Where my failures felt final, THE story reveals resurrection.

I don&#39;t know how all the pieces of my story fit together yet. I don&#39;t see the full picture. But I know the Author. I know the arc. I know the ending.

Creation. Fall. Redemption. Restoration. Consummation.

And by grace—scandalous, undeserved, transforming grace—my story is part of THE story.

That&#39;s why I sing it. To remember. To proclaim. To anchor myself in the truth that the God who began a good work in creation will complete it in consummation—and my life, with all its brokenness, is part of that beautiful, redemptive arc.

The song moves chronologically through redemption history:

<strong>Creation</strong> - Before the stars, before the sun, the Word spoke and everything came to be. We were made in His image. Designed for relationship with Him.

<strong>The Fall</strong> - Eden&#39;s garden. The serpent&#39;s lie. The fruit taken. Sin entering. Yet even then, God&#39;s love remained. A Savior promised.

<strong>The Prophecies</strong> - Kings and prophets declaring God&#39;s truth. David&#39;s line. Isaiah&#39;s suffering servant. Elijah&#39;s fire. Daniel&#39;s stand. God&#39;s faithfulness across the land.

<strong>The Incarnation</strong> - Mary chosen. Holding her baby boy. Did she know the cross He&#39;d face? Through grief, she trusted. Through loss, she prayed.

<strong>The Betrayal and Crucifixion</strong> - Leaders scheming. Betrayed by a kiss. Denied by a friend. Yet grace would triumph. Death undone. Victory through God&#39;s risen Son.

<strong>Personal Application</strong> - To die with Christ. To rise anew. My story now entwined with His. A song of hope. A life that lives.

<strong>Eternal Hope</strong> - His story echoes through all of time. One day we&#39;ll stand before His throne. Forever redeemed. Forever His own.

This is the redemption story. From beginning to end. From creation to consummation. From &quot;Let there be light&quot; to &quot;I am making all things new.&quot;

And it&#39;s not just ancient history. It&#39;s the story you&#39;re living in.

From dust we rose, His Spirit&#39;s flame,
To bear His image, to praise His name.

David, the shepherd, a king would rise,
Through his line, the Savior arrive.
Isaiah spoke of a suffering King,
Who&#39;d bear our sins and salvation bring.
Elijah&#39;s fire, Daniel&#39;s stand,
God&#39;s faithfulness across the land.

<strong>Chorus:</strong>
From the beginning, His love was displayed,
Through every fall, His promise stayed.
A Savior&#39;s grace, a story divine,
Redemption secured for hearts like mine.

<strong>Bridge:</strong>
Oh, the cross, where mercy flows,
The empty grave, the story shows.
Sin defeated, love prevailed,
Through Christ alone, redemption hailed.
Oh, the cross, where hope is found,
His grace abounds, His love profound.
He bore the weight, the debt was paid,
In Him, the victory&#39;s displayed.

<strong>Verse 4:</strong>
Mary, chosen, her heart so pure,
Through her, God&#39;s love would long endure.
She held the Savior, her baby boy,
The King of kings, her heart&#39;s great joy.
Did she know the cross He&#39;d face,
The pain, the nails, the world&#39;s disgrace?
Through grief, she trusted, through loss, she prayed,
Believing in the plan God made.

<strong>Chorus:</strong>
From the beginning, His love was displayed,
Through every fall, His promise stayed.
A Savior&#39;s grace, a story divine,
Redemption secured for hearts like mine.

<strong>Verse 5:</strong>
The leaders schemed, their hearts grew cold,
Blinded by power, they sought control.
They called Him a blasphemer, sentenced His death,
Yet love endured with His final breath.
Betrayed by a kiss for silver&#39;s gleam,
Denied by a friend in a broken dream.
Yet grace would triumph, death undone,
Victory through God&#39;s risen Son.

<strong>Chorus:</strong>
From the beginning, His love was displayed,
Through every fall, His promise stayed.
A Savior&#39;s grace, a story divine,
Redemption secured for hearts like mine.

<strong>Verse 6:</strong>
To die with Christ, to rise anew,
To walk His path, His love pursue.
The cross became the bridge to grace,
A gift of life in His embrace.
Through history&#39;s thread, His story flows,
A love eternal, a truth that grows.
My story now entwined with His,
A song of hope, a life that lives.

<strong>Final Chorus:</strong>
From the beginning, His love was displayed,
Through every fall, His promise stayed.
A Savior&#39;s grace, a story divine,
Redemption secured for hearts like mine.

<strong>Outro:</strong>
His story echoes through all of time,
A Savior&#39;s love, so pure, so kind.
One day we&#39;ll stand before His throne,
Forever redeemed, forever His own.

<h2>Reflections for the Road</h2>

These aren&#39;t academic exercises. They&#39;re invitations to see your story within THE story.

<strong>Questions for the Journey:</strong>

<ol>
<li><strong>Where do you see your story fitting into the redemption arc?</strong>

Creation - Do you recognize that you were made in God&#39;s image? That before the swamp, before the brokenness, you had dignity and worth and purpose simply because God created you?

Fall - Can you name your swamp? Your particular experience of brokenness? The ways sin marred the image?

Redemption - Where have you encountered God&#39;s grace? What was your water&#39;s edge moment? How has Jesus rescued you?

Restoration - Where are you now in the &quot;making new&quot; process? What old patterns are dying? What new life is growing?

Consummation - Do you live with hope for the final restoration? The day when all things are made new?
</li>
<li><strong>What parts of your story feel wasted? Can you trust God to redeem them?</strong>

Years in the swamp. Relationships broken. Opportunities lost. Time you can&#39;t get back.

Can you trust that God is a master at redeeming wasted years? That He&#39;s taking even the broken pieces and weaving them into a testimony of grace?

Read Genesis 50:20 slowly. &quot;You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good.&quot; Can you believe that for your story?
</li>
<li><strong>Whose redemption story encourages you?</strong>

Joseph - from pit to palace. Peter - from denial to boldness. Paul - from persecutor to apostle.

Or someone you know personally. Someone whose story demonstrates that God redeems broken pieces.

Let their story give you hope for yours. The same God who wrote their redemption arc is writing yours.
</li>
<li><strong>How does seeing your story within God&#39;s story change how you live today?</strong>

Does it give you purpose? Hope? Perseverance? Mission? Gratitude?

What would change if you really believed your life has meaning because it&#39;s part of God&#39;s grand redemption project?
</li>
<li><strong>Read Ephesians 1:9-10 and Revelation 21:5. How do these verses shape your hope?</strong>

God&#39;s plan is to unite ALL things under Christ. To make ALL things new.

You&#39;re part of that plan. Your redemption is part of God&#39;s project to restore all of creation.

How does that cosmic scope give meaning to your personal story?
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Practice: Telling Your Redemption Story</h2>

One of the most powerful spiritual practices is learning to tell your redemption story—not just for others, but for yourself. To see the arc. To recognize God&#39;s faithfulness. To remember where you&#39;ve been and where you&#39;re going.

Here&#39;s a simple framework:

<strong>1. Creation - Who you were made to be</strong>

Before the swamp. Before the brokenness. Who did God create you to be?

This isn&#39;t about romanticizing the past. It&#39;s about recognizing the image of God in you—the dignity and worth you have simply because you were created by God, for God.

What gifts did He give you? What longings? What was the original design before sin marred it?

<strong>2. Fall - Your swamp</strong>

Name it. Be specific. What was your particular experience of brokenness?

Addiction? Shame? Abuse? Betrayal? Pride? Performance-driven religion? Despair?

Don&#39;t sugarcoat it. Don&#39;t minimize it. The fall was real. The swamp was deep. Acknowledge it.

<strong>3. Redemption - Your water&#39;s edge encounter</strong>

When did you meet grace? What was your turning point?

Maybe it was dramatic—a moment of crisis and divine intervention. Maybe it was gradual—a slow awakening to God&#39;s presence.

Either way, tell the story. How did God pursue you? When did you respond? What changed?

<strong>4. Restoration - The journey since then</strong>

This is where you are now. Between &quot;already redeemed&quot; and &quot;not yet fully restored.&quot;

What has God been doing in you since the water&#39;s edge? What rhythms have you learned? What roots have you grown? What fruit has come?

Be honest about the ongoing struggle. Restoration is a process, not a moment. There are victories and setbacks. Growth and pruning. Progress and patience.

<strong>5. Consummation - The hope ahead</strong>

How does the promise of final restoration shape how you live now?

One day, all things will be made new. Fully. Completely. Eternally. You&#39;ll stand before Jesus—fully redeemed, completely restored—and you&#39;ll spend forever in His presence.

How does that hope sustain you in hard seasons? How does it give meaning to the struggles you face now?

<strong>6. Share your story</strong>

Your redemption story isn&#39;t just for you. It&#39;s a testimony of God&#39;s faithfulness that can encourage others.

Find someone to share it with. A friend. A small group. Someone who&#39;s still in the swamp and needs to hear that redemption is possible.

Don&#39;t perform it. Just tell it. Honestly. Humbly. With gratitude for the God who pursued you, redeemed you, and is still at work making you new.

Your story matters. Not because you&#39;re special. But because the Author is faithful. And when people hear your story, they hear echoes of THE story—the redemption narrative that gives hope to every wayfarer.

<h2>Closing Image</h2>

You&#39;re standing at the edge of a vast tapestry. So large you can&#39;t see the whole thing. So intricate you can&#39;t count the threads.

But you can see your section. The part you&#39;ve been working on. The threads you&#39;ve been weaving.

From up close, it looks messy. Dark threads mixed with light. Broken places where the pattern seems chaotic. Sections you&#39;d rather cut out and start over.

But then you step back.

And you begin to see it.

Your dark threads aren&#39;t mistakes. They&#39;re part of the design. The broken places aren&#39;t flaws. They&#39;re contrast that makes the bright threads shine brighter.

You step back further.

And you see that your section connects to other sections. Your story is woven into other stories. The threads intertwine. The patterns complement each other.

This isn&#39;t just your tapestry. It&#39;s part of something much larger.

You step back even further—as far as you can see.

And though you still can&#39;t see the whole tapestry, you begin to glimpse the scope. It stretches back before you can see—to creation, to Eden, to the beginning of all things. And it stretches forward beyond your vision—to restoration, to the New Jerusalem, to eternity.

This is THE tapestry. The redemption story. God&#39;s grand narrative into which every smaller story is woven.

And your threads—every joy and sorrow, every triumph and failure, every moment of grace and every season of struggle—are woven into the larger design.

Nothing is wasted. Nothing is random. Everything is part of the pattern.

You can&#39;t see the whole picture yet. But you know the Weaver. And you trust that He knows what He&#39;s doing.

One day—when the tapestry is complete, when the final thread is woven, when Jesus returns and all things are made new—you&#39;ll see it.

The whole story. From creation to consummation. Every thread in its place. Every pattern intentional. Every dark section necessary to make the bright sections shine.

And you&#39;ll see your story woven perfectly into His story. Not as an accident. Not as an afterthought. But as a beloved thread in the grand redemption narrative.

And you&#39;ll worship the Weaver who took your broken threads and wove them into something beautiful.

This is redemption&#39;s story. From the beginning, His love was displayed. Through every fall, His promise stayed.

And the story isn&#39;t finished. He&#39;s still weaving. Still making all things new. Still writing the redemption narrative that will one day culminate in complete restoration.

You&#39;re part of that story. Not a footnote. Not a side character. A beloved participant in God&#39;s grand project to redeem and restore all of creation.

Your story matters because it&#39;s part of THE story.

And the Author is faithful. From beginning to end. From creation to consummation. From &quot;Let there be light&quot; to &quot;Behold, I am making all things new.&quot;

This is the redemption story. And by grace—amazing, undeserved, transforming grace—it&#39;s your story too.

Forever redeemed. Forever His own.

<h3>MOVEMENT 3: UNFORCED RHYTHMS (The Transformation)</h3>

<h3>Chapter 12: Nothing is Wasted</h3>

[audio src="https://www.skylerthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Nothing-is-Wasted-Remastered.mp3"]
There&#39;s a peculiar grief that comes from looking back at your life and seeing waste.

Not just mistakes—those are forgivable. Not just failures—those can be redeemed.

But waste.

Time lost that you can never recover. Years spent in patterns that brought nothing but destruction. Relationships damaged beyond repair. Potential squandered. Opportunities missed.

You look at your timeline and see seasons that feel like black holes—years where nothing good grew, nothing valuable was learned, nothing redemptive emerged.

Just waste.

And the question haunts you: <em>Can God really redeem this? Or are some things just... lost?</em>

This is where grace reveals one of its most scandalous promises: in God&#39;s economy, nothing is wasted.

Not &quot;almost nothing.&quot; Not &quot;most things.&quot;

Nothing.

Every tear. Every failure. Every lost year. Every broken relationship. Every season you wish you could erase from your story—God can redeem it all.

This doesn&#39;t mean the pain wasn&#39;t real or the consequences don&#39;t matter. It means God specializes in turning crucifixions into resurrections.

He takes what looks like absolute waste and transforms it into raw material for redemption.

This chapter is about learning to see your timeline through the lens of grace. Not with denial that pretends the waste wasn&#39;t real. But with faith that believes God can redeem even what seems irredeemable. That the years you thought were lost have been woven into a larger story of transformation. That nothing—absolutely nothing—is wasted in His hands.

<hr>

<h2>Key Themes</h2>

<strong>1. Timeline Reflection: The Sacred Work of Looking Back</strong>

Part of believing nothing is wasted is doing the hard work of timeline reflection. Not to dwell in the past, but to understand how the past has shaped the present.

This isn&#39;t nostalgia. It&#39;s not rumination. It&#39;s the intentional practice of asking:

<ul>
<li>What moments brought joy?</li>
<li>What moments brought pain?</li>
<li>What patterns emerged?</li>
<li>Where was grace at work even when I couldn&#39;t see it?</li>
</ul>

Timothy Keller writes in <em>Walking with God Through Pain and Suffering</em>:

<blockquote>
&quot;If we look back on our lives with eyes of faith, we will see that even in our darkest times God&#39;s providence was lovingly at work. We may not have seen it at the time, but looking back we can trace his hand.&quot;

— Timothy Keller, <em>Walking with God Through Pain and Suffering</em>
</blockquote>

Timeline reflection requires courage. It means looking honestly at seasons you&#39;d rather forget. But it also reveals something profound: grace was present even when you couldn&#39;t feel it. God was working even when you couldn&#39;t see it.

The wayfarer who refuses to look back misses the evidence of grace. But the one who looks back with eyes of faith sees a thread—sometimes golden, sometimes crimson—woven through every season. The thread of redemption. The thread that says: nothing is wasted.

<strong>2. Counting the Cost: Present and Future</strong>

Timeline reflection looks backward. But the work of &quot;nothing is wasted&quot; also requires looking forward—counting the cost of present choices.

This isn&#39;t just about past choices and their consequences. It&#39;s about present ones. What kind of life do I want to live now? What brings me life? What drains me? Am I pursuing what&#39;s actually fulfilling, or just what&#39;s familiar?

Jerry Sittser writes in <em>A Grace Disguised</em>:

<blockquote>
&quot;The experience of loss does not have to be the defining moment of our story. The defining moment can be our response to the loss. We will know who we are by the choices we make.&quot;

— Jerry Sittser, <em>A Grace Disguised</em>
</blockquote>

When nothing is wasted, even the hard questions become tools for growth. The questions themselves are grace—invitations to live more intentionally, more authentically, more aligned with who God is calling you to become.

Counting the cost means asking: If my future self could speak to me today, what would they want me to know? What choices would they be grateful I made? What patterns would they wish I&#39;d broken sooner?

This isn&#39;t anxiety about the future. It&#39;s wisdom. It&#39;s stewarding today in light of tomorrow. It&#39;s believing that even this moment—this choice, this breath, this step—matters eternally.

<strong>3. Redeeming Relational Complexity</strong>

Family relationships can be minefields. You say something with one intention, it&#39;s received with another meaning. You offer help, it&#39;s taken as criticism. You try to be sensitive, you&#39;re told you&#39;re being &quot;too sensitive.&quot;

These moments feel wasted—painful miscommunications that just add to the pile of relational scar tissue. But when viewed through the lens of redemption, even these become opportunities. Opportunities to practice patience. To extend grace. To choose different responses.

Nicholas Wolterstorff writes in <em>Lament for a Son</em>:

<blockquote>
&quot;How is faith to endure, O God, when you allow all this scraping and tearing on us? You have allowed rivers of blood to flow, mountains of suffering to pile up, sobs to become humanity&#39;s song... But I shall not repudiate the past. For this, too, I need you. Help me to integrate my regret, my remorse, my sorrow, my anguish, into my living as a follower of Jesus Christ.&quot;

— Nicholas Wolterstorff, <em>Lament for a Son</em>
</blockquote>

Nothing wasted means: Even the hard conversations, the misunderstandings, the conflicts—God can use all of it. Not to excuse it. Not to minimize the pain. But to redeem it. To bring something good from something broken.

This doesn&#39;t happen automatically. It requires intention. It requires choosing grace over grudges. Choosing compassion over contempt. Choosing to believe that even this relational complexity is raw material for transformation.

<strong>4. Abraham and Isaac on Mount Moriah: The Test That Reveals</strong>

The story in Genesis 22 is one of the most challenging in all of Scripture. God asks Abraham to offer his son Isaac—the son of promise, the one through whom all nations would be blessed—as a sacrifice.

Abraham obeys. He takes Isaac up Mount Moriah. He builds the altar. He binds his son. He raises the knife.

And God provides a ram in the thicket. Isaac is spared. The promise is preserved.

<blockquote>
&quot;So Abraham called the name of that place, &#39;The Lord will provide&#39;; as it is said to this day, &#39;On the mount of the Lord it shall be provided.&#39;&quot;

— Genesis 22:14 (ESV)
</blockquote>

What could have been the most tragic waste—the death of the promised son—becomes instead a revelation of God&#39;s character. The Lord provides. Always. Even when it seems impossible.

Walter Brueggemann writes in <em>Genesis</em>:

<blockquote>
&quot;Abraham names the place &#39;The Lord will provide.&#39; The name is not a promise that God will supply all our needs. It is rather a confession that in the moment of greatest testing, God shows up. God intervenes. God provides a way.&quot;

— Walter Brueggemann, <em>Genesis</em>
</blockquote>

Nothing is wasted because God specializes in last-minute provision. In eleventh-hour intervention. In turning what looks like absolute waste into absolute redemption.

The test itself wasn&#39;t wasted. The fear wasn&#39;t wasted. The faith required to obey wasn&#39;t wasted. All of it became part of the story that would be told for generations: on the mountain of the Lord, it will be provided.

<strong>5. Romans 8:28 Rightly Understood</strong>

Perhaps no verse is more quoted—and more misunderstood—than Romans 8:28:

<blockquote>
&quot;And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.&quot;

— Romans 8:28
</blockquote>

This doesn&#39;t mean everything that happens is good. It doesn&#39;t mean God causes evil so good can result. It doesn&#39;t mean we should minimize pain or suffering by slapping a spiritual Band-Aid on it and saying &quot;God works all things for good.&quot;

What it does mean is this: God is relentlessly committed to redeeming every moment of your story. Even the worst ones. Even the ones that feel utterly wasted. God is at work, weaving them into something good.

Keller explains:

<blockquote>
&quot;God does not promise that he will take away the pain and suffering of this life. He promises something better—that he will be with us in it, and he will use it for his purposes and our ultimate good.&quot;

— Timothy Keller, <em>Walking with God Through Pain and Suffering</em>
</blockquote>

Romans 8:28 is not a platitude. It&#39;s a promise. A promise that your pain has purpose. Your suffering isn&#39;t random. Your struggles aren&#39;t wasted. God is working—actively, intentionally, lovingly—to bring good from it all.

Not always good you can see in the moment. Sometimes not good you&#39;ll see in this lifetime. But good nonetheless. Eternal good. The kind of good that redeems every wasted season and makes it count for eternity.

<strong>6. Suffering to Compassion: The Transformation</strong>

One of the most profound ways God ensures nothing is wasted is by transforming our suffering into compassion. What once wounded us becomes the very thing that equips us to heal others.

<blockquote>
&quot;Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from God.&quot;

— 2 Corinthians 1:3-4
</blockquote>

Your pain isn&#39;t wasted when it becomes the bridge to someone else&#39;s healing. Your struggle isn&#39;t wasted when it becomes the testimony that gives someone else hope. Your scars aren&#39;t wasted when they become the proof that wounds can heal.

Henri Nouwen writes in <em>The Wounded Healer</em>:

<blockquote>
&quot;Nobody escapes being wounded. We all are wounded people, whether physically, emotionally, mentally, or spiritually. The main question is not &#39;How can we hide our wounds?&#39; so we don&#39;t have to be embarrassed, but &#39;How can we put our woundedness in the service of others?&#39;&quot;

— Henri Nouwen, <em>The Wounded Healer</em>
</blockquote>

This is the economy of grace: nothing is wasted because every experience—even the painful ones—can become a gift to others. The years you thought were lost become the very years that qualify you to speak into someone else&#39;s lostness. The seasons you thought were wasted become the seasons that prepare you for kingdom work.

<hr>

<h2>Biblical Parallels</h2>

<strong>Abraham and Isaac: The Ram in the Thicket (Genesis 22:1-14)</strong>

The story begins with a test that seems to contradict everything God has promised. Isaac is the son of promise, the heir through whom Abraham&#39;s descendants will be as numerous as the stars. To sacrifice him would waste the promise itself.

But Abraham trusts. Even when it makes no sense. Even when the cost seems unbearable. He believes that somehow, God will provide.

And God does. At the last possible moment, a ram appears, caught in the thicket. Isaac is spared. The promise continues. And Abraham names the place &quot;The Lord will provide.&quot;

Nothing was wasted—not the fear, not the faith, not the journey up the mountain. It all became part of the testimony: on the mountain of the Lord, provision will be made.

<strong>Joseph: From Pit to Palace (Genesis 37-50)</strong>

Joseph&#39;s story is one of the clearest pictures of &quot;nothing is wasted&quot; in all of Scripture. Betrayed by his brothers. Sold into slavery. Falsely accused. Imprisoned. For years, it looked like total waste.

But God was weaving a story of redemption. The pit led to Potiphar&#39;s house. Prison led to the palace. And ultimately, Joseph&#39;s suffering positioned him to save not just Egypt, but his own family—the very ones who betrayed him.

His words to his brothers capture the heart of &quot;nothing is wasted&quot;:

<blockquote>
&quot;You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives.&quot;

— Genesis 50:20
</blockquote>

What others meant for evil, God meant for good. What looked like wasted years became the preparation for his purpose. Nothing—not the betrayal, not the slavery, not the false accusations, not the imprisonment—was wasted in God&#39;s economy.

<strong>The Cross: Ultimate Redemption of Waste (Luke 23:33-43)</strong>

If you want to see God&#39;s power to redeem waste, look at the cross. The most brutal, degrading, seemingly wasteful death imaginable. A young rabbi, full of potential, executed as a common criminal. Three years of ministry, ended. Disciples scattered. Hope crushed.

Wasted. That&#39;s what it looked like.

But that&#39;s not what it was. The cross wasn&#39;t waste—it was the hinge of history. The moment when all waste, all sin, all brokenness was gathered up and transformed. Death swallowed up in victory. The grave robbed of its power.

<blockquote>
&quot;Having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.&quot;

— Colossians 2:15
</blockquote>

If God can redeem the cross—if he can take the most wasteful, brutal death and make it the source of eternal life—then nothing in your life is beyond his redemptive reach. No season is too wasted. No pain is too great. No loss is too final.

In God&#39;s economy, nothing is wasted. Not even death itself.

<h2>Theological Anchor</h2>

<blockquote>
&quot;So Abraham called the name of that place, &#39;The Lord will provide&#39;; as it is said to this day, &#39;On the mount of the Lord it shall be provided.&#39;&quot;

— Genesis 22:14 (ESV)
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
&quot;And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.&quot;

— Romans 8:28
</blockquote>

These two passages—separated by centuries—speak the same truth: God is in the business of redemption. Of provision. Of ensuring that nothing is wasted in his hands.

Genesis 22 shows us God&#39;s character: he is the God who provides. Even when the test is unbearable. Even when obedience seems to contradict the promise. Even at the last possible moment. God provides.

Romans 8 shows us God&#39;s commitment: he works all things—not some things, but all things—for the good of those who love him. This isn&#39;t wishful thinking. It&#39;s covenant faithfulness. God has bound himself to redeem your story, no matter how broken the chapters.

Together, these passages form the theological foundation for believing nothing is wasted:

<strong>God&#39;s provision is certain.</strong> On the mountain of the Lord—in your darkest moments, your most desperate situations—provision will be made. It may not come when you expect. It may not look like you imagined. But it will come.

<strong>God&#39;s redemption is comprehensive.</strong> All things. Not just the good things. Not just the spiritual things. All things. Every moment, every experience, every pain, every struggle—God is working it for good.

This doesn&#39;t mean the pain wasn&#39;t real. It doesn&#39;t mean the waste didn&#39;t hurt. It means God specializes in turning waste into wonder. Ashes into beauty. Mourning into dancing.

Brennan Manning writes in <em>The Ragamuffin Gospel</em>:

<blockquote>
&quot;In the economy of God, nothing is wasted. Each tear, each failure, each loss becomes an opportunity for grace. The God who raised Jesus from the dead is the God who redeems every moment of our lives.&quot;

— Brennan Manning, <em>The Ragamuffin Gospel</em>
</blockquote>

This is the anchor: your story is not defined by what was wasted, but by what was redeemed. And in God&#39;s hands, everything can be redeemed.

<h2>The Wayfarer Moment</h2>

<strong>The shift from regret to redemption doesn&#39;t happen all at once. It happens one memory at a time.</strong>

For years, I carried a deep sense of regret. Time wasted. Opportunities missed. Relationships broken. Years spent in patterns that brought nothing but pain.

I would look back and see waste. Just waste. And the weight of it was crushing.

But slowly—so slowly—I began to see differently. Not because the facts changed. But because my understanding of God&#39;s character deepened.

I started to ask different questions. Not &quot;Why did I waste so much time?&quot; but &quot;Where was grace at work even when I couldn&#39;t see it?&quot;

And the answers surprised me.

The years in the swamp taught me what I couldn&#39;t learn anywhere else: my desperate need for grace. The mistakes taught me compassion for others who struggle. The broken relationships taught me the cost of pride and the beauty of humility. Even the wasted years became the very years that prepared me for the work I&#39;m doing now.

Nothing was wasted. Not because I deserved redemption. But because God specializes in it.

I began doing timeline work—intentionally looking back at my life and tracing the thread of grace through every season. The joyful seasons and the painful ones. The seasons of growth and the seasons of wandering.

And in every season, I found the same thing: God was there. Working. Weaving. Redeeming.

This didn&#39;t erase the pain. It didn&#39;t undo the consequences. But it reframed the story. What looked like waste became raw material for transformation. What felt like lost years became the very years that made me who I am.

I&#39;m learning to live from this truth: in the economy of God, nothing is wasted. Not the struggles. Not the failures. Not even the years I spent running from him.

All of it—every moment, every tear, every broken piece—God is redeeming. Repurposing. Transforming into something eternally valuable.

And if God can redeem my wasteland, he can redeem yours too.

<h2>Original Writing from the Blog</h2>

There&#39;s a saying in Christian circles that carries profound comfort: <strong>&quot;In the economy of God, nothing is wasted.&quot;</strong> It means that God does not let a single tear, a single trial, a single act of surrender go unused. He redeems every loss, repurposes every waiting season, and reshapes every broken piece into something eternally valuable.

This truth pulses through the story of Genesis 22, where Abraham, in faith, prepares to offer his son Isaac. It&#39;s a moment that tests everything—his trust, his obedience, his understanding of God. Yet Abraham moves forward, believing that somehow, <strong>the Lord will provide</strong>. And God does. A ram in the thicket. A life spared. A promise reaffirmed.

In our lives, the &quot;mountain&quot; might look like uncertainty, grief, or letting go of dreams we&#39;ve clung to for too long. But like Abraham, we are invited to trust—not in outcomes, but in God Himself.

The economy of God doesn&#39;t work like ours. We try to measure value by outcomes, by progress, by resolution. But God sees value in the hidden things: the unseen acts of obedience, the whispered prayers, the quiet endurance of faith. Even our regrets and failures, when surrendered, become instruments of grace in His hands.

So we lay it down again. We trust again. We believe again. Because we know this: <strong>in the economy of God, nothing is wasted</strong>. Not the waiting. Not the weeping. Not even the wondering.

<h2>Song Integration</h2>

<strong>What the Devotional Captures:</strong>

The devotional writing emerged from this season of looking back—not with regret anymore, but with wonder.

It names the truth: &quot;God does not let a single tear, a single trial, a single act of surrender go unused. He redeems every loss, repurposes every waiting season, and reshapes every broken piece into something eternally valuable.&quot;

This is the Abraham truth. This is the Genesis 22:14 declaration: &quot;The LORD will provide.&quot;

Even when it looks like waste. Even when it feels like loss. Even when you can&#39;t see how God could possibly redeem this—He will. He does. He is.

<strong>What the Song Adds:</strong>

The song takes the devotional&#39;s theology and makes it personal testimony.

Where the devotional proclaims &quot;nothing is wasted,&quot; the song confesses &quot;I tried to hold it all together, afraid of what I&#39;d lose.&quot;

Where the devotional declares &quot;God redeems,&quot; the song wrestles: &quot;I&#39;ve walked through days that felt like silence, and nights I couldn&#39;t catch my breath.&quot;

Where the devotional affirms &quot;the Lord will provide,&quot; the song testifies: &quot;Even when I walk through fire, You stay in the flame.&quot;

The song moves through three stages:

<ol>
<li><strong>The Struggle to Let Go</strong> (Verse 1): &quot;You asked me to let go of what I held too tight... afraid of what I&#39;d lose.&quot; This is Abraham climbing the mountain. This is me gripping my timeline, my plans, my Isaac.
</li>
<li><strong>The Valley of Waiting</strong> (Verse 2): &quot;I&#39;ve walked through days that felt like silence... I couldn&#39;t see beyond the moment.&quot; This is the wasteland feeling. The regret. The &quot;why did I waste so much time?&quot;
</li>
<li><strong>The Redemption Discovery</strong> (Verse 3): &quot;In the breaking, I found healing. In the loss, I found Your grace. You&#39;re the God who turns my ashes into beauty I can&#39;t replace.&quot; This is the Abraham moment—seeing the ram in the thicket, realizing God provided, understanding that nothing was wasted.
</li>
</ol>

And the chorus—the declaration that anchors everything: &quot;In the economy of Your love, nothing is wasted.&quot;

Not because my choices were all good. Not because I didn&#39;t truly waste years in the swamp. But because God&#39;s economy doesn&#39;t work like mine. Where I see waste, He sees raw material. Where I see loss, He sees preparation. Where I see ashes, He sees beauty.

<strong>Why the Song is a Response, Not an Echo:</strong>

The devotional tells you the truth about God&#39;s economy. The song wrestles with whether you can believe it when it&#39;s your wasted years, your broken pieces, your ashes.

The devotional says, &quot;Nothing is wasted.&quot; The song confesses, &quot;I walked through fire&quot; and testifies, &quot;You stayed in the flame.&quot;

The devotional proclaims theology. The song embodies experience.

And together, they answer the question every broken person asks: <em>Can God really redeem this?</em>

Yes. He can. He is. He will.

Because in the economy of God&#39;s love, nothing—absolutely nothing—is wasted.

<h3>Song: &quot;Nothing is Wasted&quot;</h3>

<strong>[Verse 1]</strong>
You asked me to let go of what I held too tight
The plans I made, the dreams I shaped, the pieces of my life
I tried to hold it all together, afraid of what I&#39;d lose
But love means laying down the outcome
And trusting everything to You

<strong>[Chorus]</strong>
You will provide, You always do
Even when I don&#39;t know what You&#39;re leading me through
Even when I walk through fire, You stay in the flame
You hold my sorrow, You know my name
In the valley, in the waiting, I have tasted
In the economy of Your love, nothing is wasted

<strong>[Verse 2]</strong>
I&#39;ve walked through days that felt like silence
And nights I couldn&#39;t catch my breath
I said I&#39;d follow where You led me
But I was scared of what came next
I couldn&#39;t see beyond the moment
Still You whispered, &quot;I am near&quot;
You never promised all the answers
You only asked me not to fear

<strong>[Chorus]</strong>
You will provide, You always do
Even when I don&#39;t know what You&#39;re leading me through
Even when I walk through fire, You stay in the flame
You hold my sorrow, You know my name
In the valley, in the waiting, I have tasted
In the economy of Your love, nothing is wasted

<strong>[Verse 3]</strong>
So here I am with hands wide open
Letting go of what I thought was mine
You never asked me for perfection
Just a heart that says, &quot;I&#39;ll try&quot;
And in the breaking, I found healing
In the loss, I found Your grace
You&#39;re the God who turns my ashes
Into beauty I can&#39;t replace

<strong>[Bridge]</strong>
You don&#39;t waste the waiting, You don&#39;t waste the pain
Even when I&#39;m walking through fire or rain
Every breath I breathe, every pain I&#39;ve tasted
In the economy of Your love, nothing is wasted

<strong>[Final Chorus]</strong>
You will provide, You always do
Even when I&#39;m breaking in two
Even when I walk through fire, You stay in the flame
You never leave me alone in the pain
In the valley, in the waiting, I have tasted
In the economy of Your love, nothing is wasted

<strong>[Outro]</strong>
So I lay it down again
Even when I don&#39;t understand
You are good… and nothing is wasted
You are near when I let go
You are strong when I feel low
You are kind… and nothing is wasted
You&#39;ve seen every tear I&#39;ve cried
Held my heart when hope had died
You stayed… and nothing is wasted
So I&#39;ll trust You in the silence
I&#39;ll believe You through the dark
You are faithful in the waiting
You are healing every part
I won&#39;t fear what comes tomorrow
I won&#39;t chase what&#39;s not mine to hold
You are God… and nothing is wasted

<h2>Reflections for the Road</h2>

These aren&#39;t homework assignments. They&#39;re invitations to begin living from the truth that nothing is wasted.

<strong>Questions for the Journey:</strong>

<ol>
<li><strong>What season of your life feels most &quot;wasted&quot;?</strong>

Be specific. Name it. Write it down. Where do you carry the most regret?

Now ask: Where might grace have been at work even when you couldn&#39;t see it? What might God want to redeem from that season?
</li>
<li><strong>Do timeline work: Map your life in seasons.</strong>

Draw a simple timeline of your life. Mark the major seasons—the joyful ones and the painful ones. Where do you see patterns? Where do you see the thread of grace?

This isn&#39;t about dwelling in the past. It&#39;s about understanding how the past has shaped the present, and how God has been faithful through it all.
</li>
<li><strong>What suffering in your life might God want to transform into compassion for others?</strong>

Where have you been wounded? What pain have you endured? How might that very pain become the bridge to someone else&#39;s healing?

Sometimes our greatest ministry emerges from our deepest pain. When we allow God to redeem our suffering, it stops being waste and becomes a gift.
</li>
<li><strong>Read Genesis 22 and Romans 8:28 slowly. What is God saying to you about provision and redemption?</strong>

What are you facing right now that feels like waste? What seems pointless or irredeemable?

How might God be inviting you to trust—like Abraham—that on the mountain of the Lord, provision will be made? That all things—even this thing—God is working for good?
</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>Practice: The Timeline Exercise</h2>

One of the most powerful practices for embracing &quot;nothing is wasted&quot; is creating a spiritual timeline of your life. Here&#39;s how:

<strong>1. Draw your timeline</strong>

On a large piece of paper, draw a horizontal line representing your life from birth to now. Mark major life events—births, deaths, moves, marriages, divorces, jobs, losses, celebrations.

<strong>2. Mark the spiritual seasons</strong>

Using different colors or symbols, mark seasons of spiritual growth, seasons of wandering, seasons of suffering, seasons of joy. Be honest. Don&#39;t spiritualize everything. Mark the desert seasons as deserts.

<strong>3. Look for the thread of grace</strong>

Now go back over your timeline and look for moments of grace—even in the hardest seasons. Where did God show up? Where did provision come? Where did you see his faithfulness in hindsight?

Use another color to mark these moments of grace. You may be surprised how many there are.

<strong>4. Name what you&#39;re learning</strong>

For each major season, write a one-sentence summary of what you learned or how you grew. Even the painful seasons. Even the &quot;wasted&quot; years.

You may discover that the seasons you regret most taught you things you couldn&#39;t have learned any other way.

<strong>5. Write a prayer of redemption</strong>

End by writing a prayer asking God to redeem every season. To use even the wasted years for his glory and your good. To ensure that nothing—absolutely nothing—is wasted in his economy.

This isn&#39;t magic. It won&#39;t erase the pain or undo the consequences. But it will help you see your life through the lens of redemption. It will help you believe that in God&#39;s hands, nothing is wasted.

<hr>

<h2>Closing Image</h2>

You&#39;re standing on the mountain now. Not Mount Moriah exactly, but your own mountain. The place where you&#39;ve laid down what you held most dear. Where you&#39;ve trusted even when it made no sense. Where you&#39;ve believed for provision even when you couldn&#39;t see it.

And as you look back down the mountain at the path you&#39;ve climbed, you see something you missed on the way up. Every step—even the ones that felt like backsliding. Every turn—even the wrong ones. Every season—even the wasted ones. They all led here.

Nothing was wasted. Not the swamp. Not the struggle. Not the years of wandering. All of it—every single moment—was woven into the tapestry of your story. A tapestry of redemption.

You can see the ram in the thicket now. The provision that came at just the right moment. Not when you expected. Not how you imagined. But exactly when and how it was needed.

And you understand: this is who God is. The God who provides. The God who redeems. The God who ensures that in his economy, nothing is ever wasted.

You whisper the words that Abraham whispered centuries ago: &quot;On the mountain of the Lord, it will be provided.&quot;

And you know—deep in your bones, deeper than doubt, deeper than regret—it&#39;s true.

God has provided. God is providing. God will provide.

And because of that, nothing you&#39;ve experienced, nothing you&#39;ve suffered, nothing you&#39;ve lost is wasted.

It&#39;s all raw material for redemption. All part of the story. All woven into the unforced rhythms of grace.

Nothing is wasted.

The mountain testifies to it. Your life testifies to it. And the God who brought you here will see to it that every moment—every tear, every trial, every act of surrender—counts for eternity.

On the mountain of the Lord, provision is made.

And in the economy of God, nothing is wasted.

<h3>MOVEMENT 3: UNFORCED RHYTHMS (The Transformation)</h3>

<h3>Chapter 13: Devil&#39;s On The Run</h3>

[audio src="https://www.skylerthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Devils-On-The-Run-III-Remix-Remastered-Remix.mp3"]
There&#39;s a fundamental shift that happens when you stop fighting for victory and start fighting from victory.

For years, spiritual warfare felt desperate. Every temptation was a potential defeat. Every accusation felt like it might be true. Every battle left you wondering if you&#39;d survive the next one. You were fighting for freedom, struggling to earn it, trying to prove you deserved it.

But then you discover something that changes everything:

The war is already over.

The victory isn&#39;t something you have to win—it&#39;s something Christ already won. The enemy isn&#39;t as powerful as he pretends. He&#39;s a defeated foe, stripped of authority, running from the very power that now lives in you.

This isn&#39;t positive thinking or spiritual bravado. This is the reality of the cross. Jesus didn&#39;t just survive the enemy&#39;s attack—He disarmed him. Made a public spectacle of him. Triumphed over every power of darkness.

And because you&#39;re in Christ, that victory is yours. Not someday. Right now.

This chapter is about learning to fight from rest instead of from fear. To resist from confidence instead of from desperation.

To understand that when you stand in truth, the enemy has no choice but to flee—not because you&#39;re strong, but because the One in you has already defeated him.

The devil is on the run.

And you&#39;re learning to live in the freedom of that finished victory.

<hr>

<h2>Key Themes</h2>

<strong>1. Fighting From Victory, Not For Victory</strong>

The fundamental shift in spiritual warfare is understanding that Christ has already won. The battle isn&#39;t to secure victory—it&#39;s to enforce the victory that&#39;s already been secured.

This isn&#39;t semantics. It&#39;s the difference between fighting from fear and fighting from faith. Between desperation and confidence. Between hoping to win and knowing you already have.

Neil T. Anderson writes in <em>The Bondage Breaker</em>:

<blockquote>
&quot;You don&#39;t have to fight for your freedom; you need to understand your freedom and then live accordingly. Your freedom was won by Christ on the cross. Your responsibility is to believe the truth, stand firm in it, and resist the devil&#39;s lies.&quot;

— Neil T. Anderson, <em>The Bondage Breaker</em>
</blockquote>

When you&#39;re fighting for victory, every battle feels like it could be the one that breaks you. Every temptation is a potential defeat. Every accusation carries the weight of judgment.

But when you&#39;re fighting from victory, the pressure&#39;s off. You&#39;re not trying to earn something—you&#39;re protecting something that&#39;s already yours. You&#39;re not hoping to overcome—you&#39;re standing in the overcoming power of Christ.

This is what James 4:7 means: &quot;Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.&quot; The fleeing isn&#39;t something you have to make happen through willpower or effort. It&#39;s the automatic result of standing firm in who you are in Christ. You resist, and he runs. Every time.

Because he&#39;s already defeated. And he knows it.

<strong>2. The Lies of the Enemy vs. The Truth of Grace</strong>

The devil&#39;s primary weapon isn&#39;t force—it&#39;s deception. He can&#39;t take your salvation. He can&#39;t reverse what Christ has done. But he can lie to you about it. And if he can get you to believe the lies, he can render you ineffective.

His strategy is always the same: make you doubt who you are in Christ.

<em>&quot;You&#39;re not really forgiven.&quot;</em>
<em>&quot;God is still angry with you.&quot;</em>
<em>&quot;You&#39;ve failed too many times.&quot;</em>
<em>&quot;You&#39;ll never be free.&quot;</em>
<em>&quot;This sin is too big for grace.&quot;</em>

Lies. All of them. But lies that feel true when you&#39;re in the swamp, when you&#39;re struggling, when you can&#39;t see clearly.

Chuck Lawless writes in <em>Spiritual Warfare</em>:

<blockquote>
&quot;The devil is a liar and the father of lies. He doesn&#39;t need new tricks—the old ones still work. He accuses you before God, deceives you about God&#39;s character, and blinds you to spiritual truth. But the truth of God&#39;s Word exposes every lie.&quot;

— Chuck Lawless, <em>Spiritual Warfare</em>
</blockquote>

The antidote to the enemy&#39;s lies is the truth of grace. Not just knowing the truth intellectually, but anchoring your identity in it.

You are forgiven—completely, fully, eternally.
God is not angry with you—His wrath was satisfied at the cross.
Your failures don&#39;t define you—Christ&#39;s righteousness does.
You are free—the chains are broken, the prison door is open.
No sin is too big for grace—grace is bigger than all of them combined.

When you stand in these truths, the lies lose their power. The accusations fall flat. The enemy has nothing to work with.

Because truth always defeats lies. And grace always trumps accusation.

<strong>3. Colossians 2:15 – The Public Spectacle</strong>

One of the most powerful verses in all of Scripture about spiritual warfare is Colossians 2:15:

<blockquote>
&quot;And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.&quot;

— Colossians 2:15
</blockquote>

This is the picture: Jesus on the cross, seemingly defeated. The enemy celebrating. But in that moment of apparent defeat, Jesus is actually stripping the enemy of every weapon, every claim, every authority.

And then—resurrection. The ultimate reversal. Death swallowed up in victory. The grave defeated. Satan disarmed. A public spectacle made of all the powers of darkness.

Clinton Arnold writes in <em>3 Crucial Questions About Spiritual Warfare</em>:

<blockquote>
&quot;The cross was not a defeat—it was a decisive victory. Jesus didn&#39;t just survive the enemy&#39;s attack; he stripped the enemy of his power and authority. The resurrection was the public declaration that the battle is over and Christ has won.&quot;

— Clinton Arnold, <em>3 Crucial Questions About Spiritual Warfare</em>
</blockquote>

This is why the devil is on the run. He has no authority anymore. His power was stripped at the cross. His claims were nullified in the resurrection. All he has left are lies and fear—and both crumble in the presence of truth and faith.

You&#39;re not fighting an equal opponent. You&#39;re not in a fair fight. The enemy is already defeated, already disarmed, already fleeing.

Your job isn&#39;t to defeat him—Christ did that. Your job is to stand in that victory and watch him run.

<strong>4. James 4:7 – Resist and He Will Flee</strong>

<blockquote>
&quot;Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.&quot;

— James 4:7
</blockquote>

Two actions. Two results.

Submit to God. Resist the devil.

The order matters. You can&#39;t effectively resist the enemy if you&#39;re not submitted to God. Resistance without submission is just willpower—and willpower runs out.

But when you&#39;re submitted to God—surrendered, aligned, walking in obedience—resistance becomes almost effortless. Not because you&#39;re strong, but because you&#39;re standing on ground that the enemy can&#39;t touch.

And the result? He flees. Not gradually. Not reluctantly. He runs.

C.S. Lewis captures this brilliantly in <em>The Screwtape Letters</em>:

<blockquote>
&quot;The safest road to Hell is the gradual one—the gentle slope, soft underfoot, without sudden turnings, without milestones, without signposts... But when the patient is awake and alert, when he submits to God and resists us, we have no choice but to retreat.&quot;

— C.S. Lewis, <em>The Screwtape Letters</em>
</blockquote>

The devil can&#39;t stand against someone who&#39;s submitted to God and standing in truth. He has to flee. It&#39;s not optional. It&#39;s the automatic result of your positioning.

This is the power of spiritual warfare from rest. You&#39;re not fighting in your own strength. You&#39;re standing in Christ&#39;s victory. And that victory is more than enough to send the enemy running every single time.

<strong>5. The Danger of Giving the Enemy Too Much Credit</strong>

There&#39;s a danger on the other side of spiritual warfare: giving the devil too much credit. Making him seem more powerful than he is. Living in constant fear of his schemes.

But the truth is, the devil is a defeated foe. He&#39;s on a leash. His time is limited. His power is broken. And he has no authority over those who are in Christ.

This doesn&#39;t mean we ignore spiritual warfare. It means we engage it from the right posture—not fear, but confidence. Not paranoia, but awareness. Not obsession with the enemy, but focus on Christ.

Neil T. Anderson again:

<blockquote>
&quot;Some Christians see a demon behind every bush. Others deny the reality of spiritual warfare altogether. The truth is in the middle: the enemy is real, but he&#39;s already defeated. We need to be aware, but not afraid. Alert, but not anxious. Resisting, but resting in Christ&#39;s victory.&quot;

— Neil T. Anderson, <em>The Bondage Breaker</em>
</blockquote>

The devil is on the run. That&#39;s the truth. But don&#39;t spend your life looking over your shoulder for him. Keep your eyes on Jesus. Stand firm in truth. And when the enemy shows up with his lies and accusations, resist him with confidence—knowing that he has no choice but to flee.

<strong>6. Walking in Freedom, Not Just Fighting for It</strong>

The ultimate goal of understanding spiritual warfare isn&#39;t just to fight better—it&#39;s to walk in freedom. To live in the victory that Christ has won. To stop constantly battling and start consistently abiding.

Too many Christians spend their entire lives in spiritual warfare mode—always fighting, always resisting, always on guard. And while vigilance is important, it&#39;s not the whole picture.

The whole picture is this: Christ has set you free. The chains are broken. The prison door is open. The devil is defeated.

Your job isn&#39;t to keep fighting for that freedom. It&#39;s to walk in it. To live from it. To let it shape how you think, how you respond, how you engage with life.

Paul writes in Galatians 5:1:

<blockquote>
&quot;It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery.&quot;

— Galatians 5:1
</blockquote>

Stand firm in freedom. Don&#39;t go back to slavery. Don&#39;t pick up chains that Christ has already broken. Don&#39;t believe lies that Christ has already exposed as false.

The devil is on the run. And you&#39;re free to live like it.

<h2>Biblical Parallels</h2>

<strong>Jesus&#39; Temptation in the Wilderness (Matthew 4:1-11)</strong>

After His baptism, Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. Three temptations. Three lies designed to make Jesus doubt His identity and His mission.

<em>&quot;If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become bread.&quot;</em>
<em>&quot;If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from the temple.&quot;</em>
<em>&quot;All this I will give you if you will bow down and worship me.&quot;</em>

Notice the pattern: the devil attacks identity (&quot;If you are...&quot;) and tries to offer shortcuts to what God has already promised.

Jesus&#39; response? Scripture. Truth. Every single time.

&quot;It is written...&quot;
&quot;It is also written...&quot;
&quot;Away from me, Satan! For it is written...&quot;

And the result? The devil left him. Fled. Ran.

This is the pattern for every believer. The enemy will attack your identity in Christ. He&#39;ll offer shortcuts. He&#39;ll tempt you to doubt God&#39;s promises.

Your response? Stand on truth. Speak Scripture. Resist with confidence.

And he will flee. Just like he fled from Jesus.

<strong>The Fall of Satan (Revelation 12:7-12)</strong>

Revelation gives us a cosmic perspective on spiritual warfare:

<blockquote>
&quot;Then war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back. But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven. The great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.&quot;

— Revelation 12:7-9
</blockquote>

The devil was cast down. Defeated. Expelled from heaven. And the response of heaven?

<blockquote>
&quot;Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Messiah. For the accuser of our brothers and sisters, who accuses them before our God day and night, has been hurled down.&quot;

— Revelation 12:10
</blockquote>

The accuser is cast down. His accusations no longer stand. His authority is revoked. The victory is complete.

And the call to believers?

<blockquote>
&quot;They triumphed over him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony; they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death.&quot;

— Revelation 12:11
</blockquote>

You overcome by the blood of the Lamb (Christ&#39;s finished work) and the word of your testimony (standing in truth). That&#39;s it. That&#39;s the formula.

Christ&#39;s victory + your faith = the devil on the run.

<strong>Peter&#39;s Denial and Restoration (Luke 22:31-32; John 21:15-19)</strong>

Jesus warned Peter:

<blockquote>
&quot;Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift all of you as wheat. But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.&quot;

— Luke 22:31-32
</blockquote>

Notice: Satan had to ask permission. He doesn&#39;t have free reign. He&#39;s on a leash.

Peter did deny Jesus. Three times. The enemy&#39;s attack was real.

But Jesus&#39; prayer was more powerful than Satan&#39;s sifting. And after the resurrection, Jesus restored Peter—three questions, three affirmations, three commissions. The enemy&#39;s attack was reversed. The damage was redeemed.

The devil&#39;s goal was to destroy Peter. But Jesus&#39; goal was to strengthen him through the trial. And Jesus won.

This is always the pattern: the enemy means it for harm, but God uses it for good. The devil attacks, but Christ restores. The accuser condemns, but the Advocate defends.

The devil is always on the run when Christ is on the throne.

<h2>Theological Anchor</h2>

<blockquote>
&quot;And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.&quot;

— Colossians 2:13-15
</blockquote>

The cross is the turning point of all spiritual warfare. What looked like defeat was actually the decisive victory. Jesus didn&#39;t just survive the enemy&#39;s attack—He dismantled it.

<strong>Disarmed.</strong> Every weapon the enemy had—sin, death, condemnation, accusation—was stripped away. He has no legitimate claim. No legal ground. No authority.

<strong>Public spectacle.</strong> The victory wasn&#39;t secret or private. It was public. Visible. Undeniable. The powers of darkness were put on display—defeated, humiliated, powerless.

<strong>Triumphing.</strong> This is the language of a victory parade. Jesus didn&#39;t just win—He celebrated. The cross wasn&#39;t Plan B. It was the plan. And it worked perfectly.

This is the theological foundation for &quot;the devil is on the run.&quot; Not wishful thinking. Not positive confession. Not spiritual bravado.

Reality. Accomplished fact. The cross changed everything.

Paul reinforces this in Ephesians 6:

<blockquote>
&quot;Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil&#39;s schemes.&quot;

— Ephesians 6:10-11
</blockquote>

Notice: you&#39;re strong in the Lord, not in yourself. The armor is God&#39;s armor, not your own. And the call is to stand, not to fight for ground you don&#39;t have.

You&#39;re holding ground that&#39;s already been won. Standing in victory that&#39;s already been secured. Resisting an enemy who&#39;s already been defeated.

This is spiritual warfare from rest. From confidence. From the unforced rhythms of grace.

The devil is on the run. Not because you&#39;re strong, but because Christ is victorious. And in Him, you share that victory.

<hr>

<h2>The Wayfarer Moment</h2>

<strong>The shift from fighting for victory to fighting from victory changed everything for me.</strong>

For years, I felt like I was barely holding on. Every temptation was a potential defeat. Every accusation felt true. Every battle left me exhausted, wondering if I&#39;d survive the next one.

I was fighting for victory—trying to earn it, prove it, secure it through my effort and willpower.

But I kept losing. Or at best, barely winning. And the exhaustion was crushing.

Then I encountered Colossians 2:15. &quot;Having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.&quot;

Wait. The enemy is already disarmed? Already defeated? Already on the run?

It didn&#39;t feel that way. It felt like he was winning. Gaining ground. Stealing my peace, my joy, my confidence.

But the truth wasn&#39;t about how it felt. It was about what Christ accomplished.

And slowly—so slowly—I began to shift. From fighting for victory to fighting from victory. From desperation to confidence. From fear to faith.

I started speaking truth to the lies. Not hoping the truth would work, but knowing it would.

<em>&quot;You say I&#39;m not forgiven. But Scripture says I am—completely, fully, eternally.&quot;</em>
<em>&quot;You say God is angry with me. But Scripture says His wrath was satisfied at the cross.&quot;</em>
<em>&quot;You say I&#39;ll never be free. But Scripture says whom the Son sets free is free indeed.&quot;</em>

And every time I stood on truth, the lies lost their power. The accusations fell flat. The enemy fled.

Not because I was strong. But because I was standing on ground he couldn&#39;t touch.

I&#39;m still learning this. Still growing in it. There are days when the lies feel louder than the truth. Days when I forget that the victory is already won.

But more and more, I&#39;m living from victory instead of for it. Resisting from rest instead of from fear. Standing in confidence because Christ has already triumphed.

The devil is on the run. And I&#39;m learning to live in the freedom of that reality.

<h2>Song Integration</h2>

<strong>What the Song Does:</strong>

This song is a declaration. Not a prayer for victory, but a proclamation of victory already won.

The verses tell the truth about the battle: &quot;He kicked me hard, left me buried deep.&quot; That&#39;s real. The enemy does attack. He does lie. He does try to steal, kill, and destroy.

But the chorus declares the reality: &quot;The devil is a liar, he&#39;s done. Ain&#39;t no grace where he&#39;s from. Devil&#39;s on the run—&#39;cause I&#39;m saved by grace.&quot;

Notice the past tense. He&#39;s <em>done.</em> Not &quot;will be done someday.&quot; Done now. Finished. Defeated.

And notice the reason: not because I&#39;m strong, but because I&#39;m saved by grace. The victory isn&#39;t mine—it&#39;s Christ&#39;s. And because I&#39;m in Him, His victory is my victory.

<strong>The Movement in the Song:</strong>

The song moves through three stages:

<ol>
<li><strong>The Reality of Attack</strong> (Verses 1-2): &quot;He kicked me hard...tried to take me down...pulled me low, told me lies.&quot; This acknowledges the battle is real. The enemy does attack. We&#39;re not pretending warfare doesn&#39;t exist.
</li>
<li><strong>The Declaration of Truth</strong> (Chorus): &quot;Now I rise, now I run, by the power of the Son.&quot; This is the shift—from fighting for victory to fighting from victory. The enemy tried to steal, tried to kill, &quot;but my soul he couldn&#39;t take.&quot; Why? Because it belongs to Christ.
</li>
<li><strong>The Victory Secured</strong> (Bridge): &quot;Oh the blood! Oh the Lamb! Crushed the devil with a mighty hand.&quot; This is the theological anchor—the cross is where the victory was won. Not someday. 2,000 years ago. And because Christ rose, &quot;ain&#39;t no grave gonna hold me down.&quot;
</li>
</ol>

<strong>Why the Song is a Response, Not an Echo:</strong>

If there had been a separate devotional for this chapter, it would have captured the struggle—the feeling of being overwhelmed, the weight of accusation, the exhaustion of fighting.

The song doesn&#39;t echo that struggle. It answers it.

Where the struggle asks, &quot;How do I win this battle?&quot; the song declares, &quot;The battle is already won.&quot;

Where the struggle feels the enemy&#39;s power, the song proclaims the enemy&#39;s defeat.

Where the struggle says, &quot;I&#39;m barely holding on,&quot; the song shouts, &quot;I rise, I run, by the power of the Son!&quot;

This is why there&#39;s no separate devotional for this chapter. The song itself is the declaration. The proclamation. The answer.

It&#39;s spiritual warfare set to music. Truth declared over lies. Victory proclaimed over defeat.

And every time I sing it—or hear it—I&#39;m reminded: I don&#39;t fight for victory. I fight from victory. The devil is on the run. Not because I&#39;m powerful, but because Christ is victorious. And in Him, I am free.

<h3>Song: &quot;Devil&#39;s On The Run&quot;</h3>

<strong>[Verse 1]</strong>
Devil on the run
He&#39;s a wicked beast
Tried to take me down
But he lost his feast
He kicked me hard
Left me buried deep
But I rose in grace
While he lost his keep

<strong>[Verse 2]</strong>
In my darkest night
I forgot the gift I had
He pulled me low
Told me lies and made me mad
But even in the pit
Jesus called my name
Now I walk in light
I&#39;m not the same

<strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong>
Don&#39;t be fooled
By the snake in the weeds
He don&#39;t care
&#39;Bout your hope or your needs
He can&#39;t give life
Only takes what you earn
He&#39;ll torch it all
Just to watch it burn

<strong>[Chorus]</strong>
Now I rise, now I run
By the power of the Son
But the Devil is a liar
He&#39;s Done!!
Ain&#39;t no grace where he&#39;s from
Tried to steal, tried to kill
But my soul he couldn&#39;t take
Devil&#39;s on the run
&#39;Cause I&#39;m saved by grace

<strong>[Verse 3]</strong>
Chains are gone
Yeah, the stone rolled back
He lost the war
On a bloodstained track
Truth is fire
And the lie won&#39;t stand
I&#39;m a child of God
With a sword in my hand

<strong>[Chorus – repeat]</strong>
Now I rise, now I run
By the power of the Son
But the Devil is a liar
He&#39;s Done!!
Ain&#39;t no grace where he&#39;s from
Tried to steal, tried to kill
But my soul he couldn&#39;t take
Devil&#39;s on the run
&#39;Cause I&#39;m saved by grace

<strong>[Bridge – Breakdown / Call &amp; Response]</strong>
Oh the blood!
Oh the Lamb!
Crushed the devil
With a mighty hand
Ain&#39;t no grave!
Gonna hold me down!
I&#39;ve been bought
And I wear the crown
You can growl
You can scream
But you can&#39;t run
From the King
Devil&#39;s on the run—
He lost everything

<strong>[Final Chorus – Tag out strong]</strong>
Now I rise, now I run
By the power of the Son
But the Devil is a liar
He&#39;s Done!!
Ain&#39;t no grace where he&#39;s from
Tried to steal, tried to kill
But my soul he couldn&#39;t take
Devil&#39;s on the run
Yeah, the devil&#39;s on the run
Jesus won — and I&#39;m saved by grace

<h2>Reflections for the Road</h2>

These aren&#39;t homework assignments. They&#39;re invitations to walk in the victory Christ has won.

<strong>Questions for the Journey:</strong>

<ol>
<li><strong>Where are you still fighting for victory instead of from victory?</strong>

What battles feel desperate? Where do you feel like you&#39;re barely holding on?

How might those battles change if you truly believed the victory is already won? If you stood in Christ&#39;s triumph instead of striving for your own?
</li>
<li><strong>What lies has the enemy been whispering to you?</strong>

Write them down. Be specific. What accusations feel most true? What doubts plague you most?

Now counter each lie with Scripture. Find the truth that exposes the lie. Speak it. Declare it. Stand on it.
</li>
<li><strong>Read Colossians 2:15 slowly. What does it mean that Jesus &quot;disarmed&quot; the enemy?</strong>

What weapons does the enemy no longer have? What authority has been stripped away?

How does this change the way you approach spiritual warfare?
</li>
<li><strong>Are you giving the devil too much credit—or not enough?</strong>

Do you live in fear of the enemy&#39;s power? Or do you ignore spiritual warfare altogether?

What would a balanced, biblical approach look like for you? Aware but not afraid. Alert but not anxious. Resisting but resting in Christ&#39;s victory.
</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>Practice: Truth Declarations</h2>

One of the most powerful practices for spiritual warfare is declaring truth over the enemy&#39;s lies. Here&#39;s how:

<strong>1. Identify the lie</strong>

What is the enemy whispering to you? What accusation feels most powerful? What doubt keeps coming back?

Write it down. Be specific.

<strong>2. Find the countering truth</strong>

Search Scripture for the truth that directly counters the lie. Not just any verse—the specific truth that exposes this specific lie as false.

For example:

<ul>
<li>Lie: &quot;You&#39;re not really forgiven.&quot; Truth: 1 John 1:9, Colossians 1:13-14</li>
<li>Lie: &quot;God is angry with you.&quot; Truth: Romans 5:1, Romans 8:1</li>
<li>Lie: &quot;You&#39;ll never be free.&quot; Truth: John 8:36, Galatians 5:1</li>
</ul>

<strong>3. Declare the truth out loud</strong>

Don&#39;t just think it. Speak it. There&#39;s power in verbal declaration.

&quot;Enemy, you say I&#39;m not forgiven. But God&#39;s Word says that if I confess my sins, He is faithful and just to forgive me and cleanse me from all unrighteousness. I am forgiven—completely, fully, eternally. Your lie has no power here.&quot;

<strong>4. Stand firm</strong>

The lie will come back. That&#39;s what the enemy does. But every time it returns, declare the truth again. And again. And again.

Eventually, the lie loses its power. Not because you&#39;re strong, but because truth always defeats lies.

<strong>5. Thank God for the victory</strong>

End by thanking God for the victory that&#39;s already been won. For the truth that sets you free. For the armor He provides. For the fact that in Christ, the devil is on the run.

This isn&#39;t magic. It&#39;s spiritual warfare. It&#39;s taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ (2 Corinthians 10:5). It&#39;s resisting the devil so he has no choice but to flee (James 4:7).

And it works. Because the victory is already won.

<hr>

<h2>Closing Image</h2>

You&#39;re standing on the battlefield, but the battle is over. The smoke is clearing. The enemy is retreating. And you realize—you didn&#39;t win this fight. Christ did.

The victory was secured long before you arrived. The cross was the decisive blow. The resurrection was the final confirmation. The enemy was disarmed, defeated, sent running.

Your role wasn&#39;t to win. It was to stand. To hold the ground that Christ won. To resist an enemy who has no choice but to flee.

And as you look across the battlefield, you see the truth: the devil is on the run. Not because you&#39;re powerful, but because Christ is victorious. Not because you fought hard, but because Jesus fought perfectly.

You can see him now—the enemy, scrambling, fleeing, powerless. All the lies exposed. All the accusations silenced. All the weapons stripped away.

He has nothing left. No authority. No claim. No ground to stand on.

And you? You&#39;re standing in Christ. Clothed in His righteousness. Protected by His armor. Empowered by His Spirit. Living in His victory.

The battle isn&#39;t to defeat the enemy. Christ did that at the cross.
The battle is to believe it. To stand in it. To live from it.

And when you do—when you really stand in the truth of Christ&#39;s victory—the devil has no choice but to run.

Because he&#39;s already beaten. Already disarmed. Already on the run.

And in Christ, you&#39;re on the winning side.

You whisper the truth that&#39;s become your anthem: &quot;Jesus won. The devil lost. And I&#39;m saved by grace.&quot;

And the enemy, hearing that truth, does the only thing he can do.

He runs.

Every single time.

<h3>MOVEMENT 2: AT THE WATER&#39;S EDGE (The Turning)</h3>

<h3>Chapter 7: Amazing Grace I Did Receive</h3>

[audio src="https://www.skylerthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Amazing-Grace-Male-2.mp3"]
You know the feeling when you realize you&#39;ve been given something you absolutely don&#39;t deserve?

Not a small gift. Not a favor you could repay. But something so extravagant, so unearned, so wildly disproportionate to anything you&#39;ve done that it stops you in your tracks.

That&#39;s grace.

And here&#39;s what makes it so hard to receive: we&#39;ve been conditioned to believe grace is for people who are mostly good. People who stumbled a little but tried their best. People who deserve a second chance because they&#39;ve earned it through effort.

But that&#39;s not grace. That&#39;s mercy. That&#39;s fairness. That&#39;s getting what we&#39;ve worked for.

Grace is different. Grace is scandalous.

Grace is for wretches.

Not people who stumbled—people who ran. Not people who tried their best—people who didn&#39;t even try. Not people who deserve it—people who absolutely, categorically, objectively do not.

<em>&quot;Amazing grace, how sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me.&quot;</em>

Not a mostly-good person. A wretch.

This chapter is about receiving what you don&#39;t deserve. About standing at the edge of clean water while still covered in swamp mud and discovering: the water isn&#39;t waiting for you to clean up first.

The water is what cleans you up.

The writing that follows came from my encounter with scandalous grace. When I&#39;d trampled on every gift, ignored every warning, chosen my way instead of His—and discovered grace wasn&#39;t done with me.

Grace, in fact, had just begun.

<hr>

<h2>Key Themes</h2>

<strong>1. The Scandal of Grace: For the Undeserving</strong>

Grace is scandalous precisely because it&#39;s for people who don&#39;t deserve it. If you deserved it, it wouldn&#39;t be grace—it would be payment. A transaction. You do X, you get Y.

But grace isn&#39;t a transaction. It&#39;s a gift. Freely given to those who can never earn it, never repay it, never deserve it.

This offends us. Deeply.

Because we&#39;ve been trained to believe you get what you earn. Work hard, get rewarded. Mess up, face consequences. The world runs on merit, on fairness, on getting what you deserve.

But grace shatters that entire system.

The Apostle Paul writes in Ephesians 2:8-9:

<blockquote>
&quot;For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast.&quot;

— Ephesians 2:8-9
</blockquote>

Not by works. Not by trying harder. Not by cleaning yourself up first. By grace. Through faith. A gift.

Jonah&#39;s story illustrates this perfectly. He received a clear call from God: go to Nineveh and call the people to repentance. But Jonah fled in the opposite direction, boarding a ship to Tarshish. He thought he could outrun God, create his own path, define his own freedom.

This is our human condition—we hear God&#39;s call, but our hearts are afraid, prideful, stubborn. We think we know better. We convince ourselves that our version of freedom will bring fulfillment.

When Jonah fled, he wasn&#39;t seeking freedom—he was seeking autonomy. Control. The right to write his own story without God&#39;s interference. And that path led him straight into the belly of a fish, trapped in the very darkness he&#39;d been trying to escape.

In that belly, in that darkness, Jonah cried out: &quot;In my distress I called to the LORD, and he answered me. From the depths of the grave I called for help, and you listened to my cry&quot; (Jonah 2:2).

He didn&#39;t clean himself up first. Didn&#39;t earn the right to be heard. From the grave of his own making, from the consequences of his own rebellion, he cried out.

And God answered.

That&#39;s the scandal. God doesn&#39;t wait for us to deserve rescue. He rescues us while we&#39;re still in the belly of the whale.

Philip Yancey writes powerfully about this scandal:

<blockquote>
&quot;Grace is the most dangerous, revolutionary, unexpected, and free force the world has ever seen or will ever see. It is wild and uncontrollable. When people taste it, they become addicted to it.&quot;

— Philip Yancey, <em>What&#39;s So Amazing About Grace?</em>
</blockquote>

Grace is dangerous precisely because it refuses to play by our rules. It doesn&#39;t wait for worthiness. It doesn&#39;t demand payment. It just gives—freely, scandalously, outrageously.

<strong>2. Trading True Freedom for False Freedom</strong>

The writing from the blog captures this perfectly:

<em>&quot;I traded it in for my version of freedom / Ruling others from my own throne / Instead of following the Master&#39;s plan / I wrote one of my own.&quot;</em>

We think freedom means autonomy. No rules. No boundaries. No one telling us what to do. We sit on our self-made thrones and convince ourselves we&#39;re liberated.

But autonomy isn&#39;t freedom. It&#39;s slavery in disguise.

When we attempt to rule our own lives without God, we don&#39;t escape constraints—we just exchange God&#39;s life-giving boundaries for the soul-crushing bondage of sin. We become enslaved to our appetites. Our pride. Our need to control. Our fear of being exposed.

The freedom we think we&#39;ve found leads us down a dead-end path.

And at the end of that path? A grave. Not physical death necessarily, but spiritual death. Isolation. Emptiness. The slow suffocation of a soul trying to live on its own terms.

Real freedom isn&#39;t found in throwing off all restraints. Real freedom is found in surrender.

Jesus says in John 8:36: &quot;So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.&quot;

Not freedom to do whatever we want. Freedom to become who we were created to be. Freedom from the tyranny of self. Freedom to live in the flow of God&#39;s love instead of fighting against it.

Timothy Keller captures this paradox:

<blockquote>
&quot;The Christian gospel is that I am so flawed that Jesus had to die for me, yet I am so loved and valued that Jesus was glad to die for me. This leads to deep humility and deep confidence at the same time.&quot;

— Timothy Keller, <em>The Prodigal God</em>
</blockquote>

True freedom isn&#39;t found in ruling our own throne—it&#39;s found in bowing before the only King who died to set us free. That&#39;s the freedom Jonah discovered in the belly of the fish, the freedom that leads us from the grave to the water&#39;s edge.

The pathway to this freedom is counterintuitive: it requires us to step off our dead-end road and run toward the very One we&#39;ve been fleeing from.

<strong>3. From the Grave to the Water&#39;s Edge</strong>

The progression in the writing is crucial:

<ul>
<li><em>&quot;The freedom I was living / Turned out to make me a slave&quot;</em></li>
<li><em>&quot;Rather than bringing life to me / It buried me in my own grave&quot;</em></li>
<li><em>&quot;He led me down a dead end path / So He could show me His vision&quot;</em></li>
<li><em>&quot;It stopped way short of the water of life / And I had to make a decision&quot;</em></li>
</ul>

God doesn&#39;t usually intervene the moment we start running. He lets us run. Lets the path we&#39;ve chosen reveal its true nature. Lets us reach the dead end.

Not because He&#39;s cruel. Because that&#39;s when we&#39;re finally ready to listen.

As long as we think our path might work, we won&#39;t turn around. But when we hit the wall, when the road dead-ends, when we&#39;re standing in a grave of our own making—that&#39;s when grace becomes not just nice but necessary.

And at that dead end, there&#39;s a choice: turn around or stay buried.

The water of life is right there. Close enough to see. Close enough to reach. But there&#39;s a gap between the dead-end road and the water&#39;s edge. And crossing that gap requires a decision.

Will we stay on the familiar path, even though it&#39;s killing us? Or will we step off into the unknown, trusting that God will catch us?

<strong>4. The Decision: Fleeing or Embracing</strong>

<em>&quot;Would I turn around and walk away / Fleeing from the water&#39;s edge / Or would I leave my road and run to Him / Embracing His freedom pledge&quot;</em>

This is the hinge moment. The turning point. Everything comes down to this choice.

Grace is offered. The water is there. The invitation is extended. But grace must be received. We have to choose to step toward it.

And here&#39;s what&#39;s so tender about this moment: God doesn&#39;t force us. He invites. He calls. He stands at the water&#39;s edge with arms open. But He waits for us to come.

Why? Because love that&#39;s forced isn&#39;t love. Rescue that&#39;s imposed isn&#39;t freedom.

God wants relationship, not robots. So He offers grace and waits for our response.

The wayfarer in the story makes the choice: &quot;I stepped off that dead end road / And simply trusted He would save.&quot;

Notice the word: simply. Not &quot;I cleaned myself up and then approached.&quot; Not &quot;I proved I was worthy and then stepped forward.&quot; Simply trusted.

That&#39;s all grace requires. Not perfection. Not performance. Just trust.

Trust that God is who He says He is. Trust that grace is real. Trust that the water won&#39;t reject you.

<strong>5. The Lifting: God&#39;s Hand Raises Us</strong>

<em>&quot;With each step I took, I felt His hand / Lifting me out of my grave&quot;</em>

This is the miracle of grace. We step toward the water, and God&#39;s hand meets us. We take one step of faith, and He carries us the rest of the way.

We don&#39;t pull ourselves out of the grave. We can&#39;t. We&#39;re dead in it.

But when we trust—when we simply turn toward the water and step—God&#39;s hand reaches down and lifts us out.

Paul captures this in Ephesians 2:4-5:

<blockquote>
&quot;But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you have been saved.&quot;

— Ephesians 2:4-5
</blockquote>

Made us alive. Not &quot;helped us get a little better.&quot; Not &quot;gave us a boost.&quot; Made us alive.

That&#39;s resurrection language. That&#39;s dead-to-life language. That&#39;s grace language.

You can&#39;t resurrect yourself. You can only be resurrected. And that&#39;s what God does when you step toward the water. He doesn&#39;t just wash you. He raises you.

From death to life. From grave to grace. From wretch to beloved.

<strong>6. Addressing Objections: Cheap Grace vs. Costly Grace</strong>

Whenever we talk about grace being free, unearned, and given to the undeserving, someone will object: &quot;But doesn&#39;t that make grace cheap? Doesn&#39;t that give people license to sin?&quot;

Dietrich Bonhoeffer addressed this in his book <em>The Cost of Discipleship</em>. He distinguished between cheap grace and costly grace.

Cheap grace is grace without discipleship. Grace without transformation. Grace that says, &quot;You&#39;re forgiven, so keep living however you want.&quot; It&#39;s grace as a Get Out of Jail Free card that you pocket and then go back to your old life.

Costly grace is grace that costs God everything—the life of His Son on the cross—and costs us everything too. Not to earn it, but as a response to it. When you truly encounter grace, it doesn&#39;t leave you unchanged. It transforms you.

Bonhoeffer writes:

<blockquote>
&quot;Cheap grace is the preaching of forgiveness without requiring repentance, baptism without church discipline, Communion without confession, absolution without personal confession. Cheap grace is grace without discipleship, grace without the cross, grace without Jesus Christ, living and incarnate. Costly grace is the treasure hidden in the field; for the sake of it a man will gladly go and sell all that he has.&quot;

— Dietrich Bonhoeffer, <em>The Cost of Discipleship</em>
</blockquote>

The grace we encounter at the water&#39;s edge is costly—not in what we pay to receive it, but in what it cost Christ to offer it, and in how completely it transforms us when we truly receive it.

Costly grace says: &quot;You&#39;re forgiven, and because of that, you&#39;re free to become who you were always meant to be. Not by striving, but by surrendering. Not by performing, but by receiving and then living out of the abundance of what you&#39;ve received.&quot;

The grace extended at the water&#39;s edge is costly grace. It cost Jesus His life. And it will cost us our old life—the one built on autonomy and self-rule. But what we gain in exchange is life itself. Real life. Abundant life. Eternal life.

<h2>Biblical Parallels</h2>

<strong>Jonah: Running from God, Saved by Grace (Jonah 1-2)</strong>

We&#39;ve touched on Jonah already, but his story deserves deeper exploration because it&#39;s the perfect picture of grace pursuing the rebellious.

Jonah receives God&#39;s call: go to Nineveh. He boards a ship going the opposite direction. A storm arises. Jonah knows it&#39;s because of him. He tells the sailors to throw him overboard.

And here&#39;s where it gets interesting: Jonah expects to die. He&#39;s running from God, and he&#39;d rather die than obey. But God doesn&#39;t let him die.

Instead, God provides a fish to swallow him. And inside that fish, in the belly of darkness, Jonah prays:

<blockquote>
&quot;In my distress I called to the LORD, and he answered me. From the depths of the grave I called for help, and you listened to my cry.&quot;

— Jonah 2:2
</blockquote>

From the grave. That&#39;s where Jonah is. Spiritually, emotionally, physically—he&#39;s in the grave. And from there, he cries out. And God answers.

God doesn&#39;t lecture Jonah. Doesn&#39;t shame him. Doesn&#39;t say, &quot;You should have listened the first time.&quot; God simply rescues him. The fish vomits Jonah onto dry land, and God&#39;s call comes again: &quot;Go to Nineveh.&quot;

This is amazing grace. Grace that pursues the runner. Grace that rescues the rebel. Grace that gives second chances—and third, and fourth, and hundredth.

<strong>The Prodigal Son: From the Pigpen to the Father&#39;s Embrace (Luke 15:11-32)</strong>

The younger son demands his inheritance early (essentially wishing his father dead), leaves home, squanders everything in wild living, and ends up in a pigpen, so desperate he&#39;s eating pig food.

From that pigpen, he makes a decision: &quot;I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants&quot; (Luke 15:18-19).

He&#39;s not expecting grace. He&#39;s expecting to be a servant at best. He&#39;s rehearsing his speech, his apology, his offer to earn his way back.

But watch what happens:

<blockquote>
&quot;But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him.&quot;

— Luke 15:20
</blockquote>

The father doesn&#39;t wait for the apology. Doesn&#39;t wait for the son to grovel. While the son is still far off, the father runs.

And when the son tries to give his speech, the father cuts him off. He calls for the best robe, a ring, sandals. He throws a party.

This is scandalous grace. The son deserves nothing. He&#39;s squandered everything. He&#39;s come home smelling like pigs. But the father doesn&#39;t care about what he deserves. The father cares about who he is: his son.

Grace isn&#39;t based on worthiness. It&#39;s based on relationship. And in God&#39;s economy, you&#39;re a son or daughter not because you&#39;ve earned it but because He&#39;s declared it.

<strong>The Woman Caught in Adultery: No Condemnation (John 8:1-11)</strong>

The religious leaders drag a woman caught in adultery before Jesus. The Law says she should be stoned. They&#39;re testing Jesus, trying to trap Him.

Jesus bends down and writes in the dust. Then He says: &quot;Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her&quot; (John 8:7).

One by one, the accusers leave. Starting with the oldest—the ones who&#39;ve lived long enough to know their own sin.

Finally, it&#39;s just Jesus and the woman. And Jesus asks:

<blockquote>
&quot;Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?&quot; &quot;No one, sir,&quot; she said. &quot;Then neither do I condemn you,&quot; Jesus declared. &quot;Go now and leave your life of sin.&quot;

— John 8:10-11
</blockquote>

No condemnation. Not &quot;You&#39;re forgiven because you promised never to do it again.&quot; Not &quot;You&#39;re forgiven because you&#39;ve suffered enough.&quot; Just: &quot;Neither do I condemn you.&quot;

That&#39;s grace. Unearned. Undeserved. Freely given.

And notice what follows: &quot;Go now and leave your life of sin.&quot; Grace doesn&#39;t excuse sin—it empowers transformation. It doesn&#39;t say, &quot;Keep living however you want.&quot; It says, &quot;You&#39;re free now. Free from condemnation. Free from the power of sin. So go live like the free person you are.&quot;

<strong>Zacchaeus: Grace That Seeks the Seeker (Luke 19:1-10)</strong>

Zacchaeus is a chief tax collector—a collaborator with Rome, a thief who&#39;s grown rich by extorting his own people. He&#39;s hated. Despised. Excluded.

But he&#39;s curious about Jesus. So he climbs a tree to see Him.

Jesus stops under the tree, looks up, and says: &quot;Zacchaeus, come down immediately. I must stay at your house today&quot; (Luke 19:5).

The crowd grumbles: &quot;He has gone to be the guest of a sinner.&quot;

But Zacchaeus responds to grace with transformation: &quot;Look, Lord! Here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount&quot; (Luke 19:8).

Jesus didn&#39;t demand restitution first. He offered relationship first. And the relationship produced transformation.

That&#39;s how grace works. It doesn&#39;t wait for us to fix ourselves. It meets us where we are, offers relationship, and then—out of that relationship—transformation flows.

John Ortberg captures this perfectly:

<blockquote>
&quot;Grace is the offer of God&#39;s ceaseless presence and irrational love. The only thing you have to do is to want to be with Jesus more than you want anything else.&quot;

— John Ortberg, <em>The Me I Want to Be</em>
</blockquote>

Zacchaeus wanted to see Jesus more than he wanted to maintain his reputation. He climbed a tree—ridiculous for a wealthy tax collector. And Jesus saw him, called him down, and offered relationship. That&#39;s grace—meeting us in our ridiculous, desperate seeking and saying, &quot;Come down. I want to be with you.&quot;

<h2>Theological Anchor</h2>

<blockquote>
&quot;For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast.&quot;

— Ephesians 2:8-9
</blockquote>

Let&#39;s unpack this verse phrase by phrase, because it&#39;s the theological bedrock of everything we&#39;re exploring.

<strong>&quot;By grace you have been saved&quot;:</strong>

Grace is the means. Not effort. Not goodness. Not trying really hard. Grace.

And notice the tense: &quot;have been saved.&quot; It&#39;s done. Accomplished. Complete. You&#39;re not trying to get saved. If you&#39;re in Christ, you are saved. Present reality, not future hope.

<strong>&quot;Through faith&quot;:</strong>

Faith is the instrument. The way grace is received. Not works, but trust. Belief. Reliance on God&#39;s promise rather than your own ability.

Faith isn&#39;t the same as perfection. You don&#39;t have to have perfect faith to be saved. You just have to have faith—even mustard-seed-sized faith—in a perfect Savior.

<strong>&quot;And this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God&quot;:</strong>

This is crucial. Both the salvation and the faith are gifts. You can&#39;t even take credit for believing. God gives the grace. God gives the faith. You receive.

Why does Paul emphasize this? Because our default mode is to try to contribute something. To earn a little bit. To prove we&#39;re worthy. But grace, by definition, can&#39;t be earned. The moment you think you&#39;ve contributed to your salvation, you&#39;ve moved from grace to works. And works can&#39;t save.

<strong>&quot;Not by works, so that no one can boast&quot;:</strong>

If salvation were by works, then the people who did the most works would have bragging rights. They&#39;d be &quot;better Christians&quot; than those who did fewer works.

But in grace, there&#39;s no hierarchy. The apostle Paul and the thief on the cross stand before God on the same footing: utterly dependent on grace.

No one can boast. Not about how good they are. Not about how hard they tried. Not about how much they&#39;ve done for God.

We can only boast in this: Amazing grace, how sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me.

Andrew Murray beautifully expresses this:

<blockquote>
&quot;The first link between my soul and Christ is not my goodness but my badness, not my merit but my misery, not my standing but my falling, not my riches but my need.&quot;

— Andrew Murray, <em>Abide in Christ</em>
</blockquote>

We don&#39;t come to grace because we&#39;re good enough. We come because we&#39;re desperate enough. And that desperation—that acknowledgment of our wretchedness—is the beginning of transformation.

<hr>

<h2>The Wayfarer Moment</h2>

<strong>When grace stops being doctrine and becomes your story.</strong>

You can know the theology of grace—memorize Ephesians 2:8-9, understand justification by faith, articulate the difference between cheap and costly grace—and still not experience grace.

<blockquote>
&quot;For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast.&quot;

— Ephesians 2:8-9
</blockquote>

Because grace isn&#39;t just a doctrine. It&#39;s an encounter.

The wayfarer moment is when you stop understanding grace in the abstract and start experiencing it in the specific. When it&#39;s not just &quot;God loves the world&quot; but &quot;God loves me.&quot; Not just &quot;Jesus died for sinners&quot; but &quot;Jesus died for me.&quot;

This is what happened in the story from the blog. The writer wasn&#39;t learning about grace for the first time. They&#39;d grown up in a Christian home, been taught the faith, knew the path they should follow.

But they&#39;d trampled on that gift. Traded it for autonomy. Ruled from their own throne. And ended up in a grave of their own making.

The wayfarer moment came when they stood at the dead end of their self-made path and heard the whisper: &quot;Turn around. The water is here. Just trust Me.&quot;

And they did. One step. Then another. And with each step, they felt God&#39;s hand lifting them out of the grave.

That&#39;s when grace stopped being a hymn they sang and became their testimony.

<em>I once was lost but now I&#39;m found. Was blind but now I see.</em>

Not theological theory. Personal history.

<hr>

<h2>Original Writing from the Blog</h2>

Amazing Grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
But I trampled on that gift of life
Refusing to be set free

I traded it in for my version of freedom
Ruling others from my own throne
Instead of following the Master&#39;s plan
I wrote one of my own

I failed to see that it was a lie
A folly from the master of deceit
I thought I invented it on my own
How the system I would cheat

I learned the art of hiding out
And dodging from my own shame
Never taking responsibility
Everyone else was to blame

But in the end I was the fool
For freedom I did not understand
Freedom is not free you see
It didn&#39;t work out how I planned

The freedom I was living
Turned out to make me a slave
Rather than bringing life to me
It buried me in my own grave

He led me down a dead end path
So He could show me His vision
It stopped way short of the water of life
And I had to make a decision

Would I turn around and walk away
Fleeing from the water&#39;s edge
Or would I leave my road and run to Him
Embracing His freedom pledge

I stepped off that dead end road
And simply trusted He would save
With each step I took, I felt His hand
Lifting me out of my grave

Amazing Grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I&#39;m found
Was blind but now I see

<h2>Song Integration</h2>

This writing came out of a time when I&#39;d been living what I thought was freedom—making my own choices, ruling my own life, writing my own plan. I&#39;d grown up knowing the truth, but I&#39;d convinced myself I could improve on it. Make it work better for me.

The lie was subtle: &quot;You don&#39;t have to rebel completely. Just tweak the plan a little. Take what works, leave what doesn&#39;t. You&#39;re smart enough to figure this out.&quot;

But autonomy is a dead-end road. It doesn&#39;t look like a dead end at first. It looks like freedom, like possibility, like the open road. But eventually, it stops. It hits a wall. And you realize you&#39;re standing in a grave of your own making.

For me, that moment came when I couldn&#39;t hide anymore. When the consequences of my choices caught up with me. When the shame I&#39;d been dodging finally cornered me and I had to face the truth: I&#39;d trampled on grace. I&#39;d taken the gift of life and thrown it away for a counterfeit.

I expected condemnation. I deserved it. If there&#39;s a line between &quot;forgivable&quot; and &quot;too far gone,&quot; I was sure I&#39;d crossed it.

But standing at that dead end, I heard the invitation: Turn around. The water is here.

I looked back over my shoulder and saw it. The water&#39;s edge. Living water. Clean, clear, flowing. And Jesus standing there, arms open, saying: &quot;Come. Just trust Me. I&#39;ll lift you out.&quot;

I didn&#39;t deserve it. But grace isn&#39;t about what I deserve. It&#39;s about who He is.

So I stepped off the dead-end road. One step. Then another. And with each step, I felt His hand. Lifting me. Carrying me. Raising me from the grave I&#39;d dug.

The old hymn became my testimony: <em>I once was lost but now I&#39;m found. Was blind but now I see.</em>

This writing is my re-telling of that hymn. My personal declaration of what grace did for me when I was too far gone to save myself.

<h3>Song: &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;</h3>

Oh, Your grace, how sweet the sound
It called me when I was bound

<h2>Reflections for the Road</h2>

These questions aren&#39;t homework. They&#39;re invitations to encounter grace personally.

<strong>Questions for the Journey:</strong>

<ol>
<li><strong>Where are you trading true freedom for false freedom?</strong>

What self-made throne are you sitting on? Where are you trying to write your own plan instead of following God&#39;s? Be specific. Name it. Because you can&#39;t step off a path you won&#39;t admit you&#39;re on.
</li>
<li><strong>What dead-end road has God let you travel to show you His vision?</strong>

Sometimes God lets us exhaust our own options before He reveals His. Not to punish us, but to prepare us to receive what He&#39;s offering. Where has your path dead-ended? And what is God showing you from that vantage point?
</li>
<li><strong>What&#39;s keeping you from stepping toward the water&#39;s edge?</strong>

Is it shame? The belief that you&#39;ve gone too far? The fear that grace has limits and you&#39;ve exceeded them? Name the obstacle. Bring it into the light. Because shame loses its power when it&#39;s spoken aloud.
</li>
<li><strong>Read Luke 15:11-32 slowly. Put yourself in the prodigal&#39;s place. What would it feel like to have the Father run toward you?</strong>

Don&#39;t rush this. Imagine standing far off, still in your filth, rehearsing your apology. And then imagine seeing the Father—not waiting sternly at the door, but running toward you with arms open. What would that do to your heart?
</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>Practice: Writing Your Grace Story</h2>

Grace becomes real when it becomes personal. When it&#39;s not just doctrine but story.

Take some time—unhurried time—and write your own grace story. Not a theological essay. A story.

Answer these prompts:

<ul>
<li>Where was I when grace found me?</li>
<li>What dead-end road had I traveled?</li>
<li>What did I think about myself? About God? About my worthiness to be loved?</li>
<li>When did I hear the invitation to turn toward the water&#39;s edge?</li>
<li>What did stepping toward grace feel like?</li>
<li>How has grace lifted me from my grave?</li>
</ul>

Don&#39;t worry about making it sound polished or spiritual. Write it honestly. Write it in your own voice. Write it as your testimony.

And then, if possible, share it with someone. Not to impress them. Just to declare it. To say out loud: This is what grace did for me.

Because when grace stops being doctrine and becomes your story, it changes everything.

<hr>

<h2>Closing Image</h2>

You&#39;re standing in the water now. Not all the way in yet—just ankle-deep. But you&#39;re in.

And the water is exactly what was promised. Living. Flowing. Clean.

The mud from the swamp is starting to wash away. Not all at once, but gradually. With each step deeper, more of it lifts off and is carried downstream.

You look down at your feet and you can see them clearly for the first time in years. The water is so clear you can see straight to the bottom. And you realize: This is what I&#39;ve been longing for. Not just to be clean, but to be seen—truly seen—and loved anyway.

You cup water in your hands and pour it over your arms. The mud runs off in brown streams. Underneath: skin. Your actual skin. You&#39;d almost forgotten what it looked like.

You&#39;re still a mess. You&#39;re still covered in swamp residue. But you&#39;re also being washed. Both are true at the same time.

And from somewhere deep inside—deeper than the shame, deeper than the fear, deeper than the old lies—you hear it rising up. Your voice. Singing.

<em>Amazing grace, how sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me. I once was lost but now I&#39;m found, was blind but now I see.</em>

It&#39;s not just a hymn anymore. It&#39;s your story.

You&#39;re at the water&#39;s edge. You&#39;ve stepped in. And grace is washing you clean.

One step at a time. One breath at a time. One grace-filled moment at a time.

You&#39;re being made new. And it&#39;s only just beginning.

<h3>MOVEMENT 3: UNFORCED RHYTHMS (The Transformation)</h3>

<h3>Chapter 10: Deep Roots, Strong Growth</h3>

[audio src="https://www.skylerthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/I-Will-Trust-You-Lord.mp3"]
You can spot the difference between a plant with deep roots and one with shallow roots from a single summer.

When drought comes, the shallow-rooted plant withers first. Its leaves yellow. Its stem weakens. It looks healthy enough when conditions are ideal, but it has no reserves. No depth. Nothing to draw from when surface water dries up.

The deep-rooted plant? It stays green. Not because it&#39;s stronger or trying harder.

Because its roots have gone deep enough to reach water others can&#39;t access.

This chapter is about spiritual depth. Not the flashy kind that impresses people. The hidden kind that sustains you when no one&#39;s watching. The kind that grows underground, unseen, unremarkable—but makes all the difference when the heat comes.

Here&#39;s what you&#39;re learning: rhythms are good, but rhythms without roots become rote. Practices are helpful, but practices without depth become performance.

You need more than sustainable patterns. You need deep foundations.

The question isn&#39;t just &quot;How do I walk in rhythm?&quot; It&#39;s &quot;How do I stay rooted when storms come? How do I keep from sliding back? How do I build a life that thrives, not just survives?&quot;

The answer is roots. Deep roots. The kind that reach down to streams of living water and anchor you when everything else shakes.

The writing that follows came from my discovery that spiritual disciplines aren&#39;t about trying harder.

They&#39;re about sending roots deeper. About staying connected to the Source in ways that transform you from the inside out.

<h2>Key Themes</h2>

<strong>1. The Work of Putting to Death</strong>

There&#39;s a paradox at the heart of spiritual growth: before roots can go deep into what belongs, they have to let go of what doesn&#39;t.

Deep roots require putting to death:

<strong>Pride</strong> - The need to be right. The compulsion to prove ourselves. The addiction to being seen, recognized, validated by others. Pride keeps our roots shallow because it keeps us focused on ourselves rather than God. We&#39;re constantly comparing, competing, defending, performing. All that energy goes into image management rather than transformation.

The antidote isn&#39;t self-hatred. It&#39;s what Paul calls in Philippians 2 &quot;considering others more significant than yourselves.&quot; The humility that says, &quot;I don&#39;t have to win this argument. I don&#39;t have to prove I&#39;m right. I can be wrong and still be loved.&quot;

Pride keeps you on the surface, performing. Humility sends roots deep, receiving.

<strong>Reactivity</strong> - Responding from wounds instead of from identity. When someone criticizes you, do you react defensively? When life doesn&#39;t go your way, do you lash out? When you feel threatened, do you attack?

Reactivity is living from your False Self—the wounded, defended, self-protective version of you. Deep roots grow when you learn to respond from your True Self—the beloved, secure, grounded-in-God version of you.

This doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t feel pain. You do. But you don&#39;t let the pain control your response.

You feel it, name it, bring it to God, and then choose how to respond rather than simply reacting.

<strong>Isolation</strong> - The temptation to withdraw when things get hard. To hide your struggles. To pretend you&#39;re fine when you&#39;re not. To go it alone because you&#39;re afraid of being a burden or being rejected.

Isolation is the enemy of deep roots. Trees don&#39;t grow in isolation—they grow in groves, forests, communities where their roots intertwine with other roots, creating stability and sharing nutrients.

You need community. Not performative community where everyone pretends to have it all together. Real community where you can be honest about your struggles, receive prayer, offer support, and grow together.

Deep roots require staying connected even when you want to withdraw.

<strong>Bitterness</strong> - The nursing of perceived injustices. The rehearsal of how you&#39;ve been wronged. The keeping of records. The refusal to forgive.

Bitterness is like poison in the soil. It doesn&#39;t hurt the person you&#39;re bitter toward—it hurts you. It keeps your roots shallow and twisted, unable to reach the streams of living water because they&#39;re too busy clinging to old wounds.

Forgiveness doesn&#39;t mean what happened was okay. It means you&#39;re releasing it so it doesn&#39;t control you anymore.

You&#39;re letting go so your roots can grow deep into grace rather than staying tangled in grievance.

This is hard work. Dying work. But it&#39;s necessary work.

Because you can&#39;t grow deep roots in poisoned soil.

<strong>2. The Work of Cultivating What Belongs</strong>

Putting to death is only half the work. The other half is cultivating what belongs—the virtues, practices, and postures that create conditions for deep roots.

<strong>Humility</strong> - Acknowledging your need for grace. Admitting you don&#39;t have it all together. Embracing your limits rather than pretending they don&#39;t exist.

Richard Foster writes:

<blockquote>
&quot;Superficiality is the curse of our age. The doctrine of instant satisfaction is a primary spiritual problem. The desperate need today is not for a greater number of intelligent people, or gifted people, but for deep people.&quot;

— Richard Foster, <em>Celebration of Discipline</em>
</blockquote>

Humility is the path to depth. Because humility says, &quot;I need help. I need God. I need community. I need grace.&quot; And that acknowledgment positions you to receive what you need.

Pride keeps you on the surface, performing. Humility sends roots deep, receiving.

<strong>Responsiveness</strong> - Acting from your True Self, not your wounded self. Learning to pause between stimulus and response. Choosing how you&#39;ll act rather than simply reacting.

This requires self-awareness—knowing your triggers, understanding your patterns, recognizing when you&#39;re operating from wounds versus operating from belovedness.

And it requires spiritual practices—silence and solitude to hear God&#39;s voice, prayer to seek His guidance, Scripture to renew your mind, community to hold you accountable.

Deep roots make you responsive rather than reactive. Grounded rather than tossed about. Stable rather than volatile.

<strong>Connection</strong> - Staying engaged even when vulnerable. Showing up even when it&#39;s hard. Choosing relationship over isolation.

John Ortberg writes about the importance of spiritual community in <em>Everybody&#39;s Normal Till You Get to Know Them</em>:

<blockquote>
&quot;Being in community is like being in a pool. It&#39;s easier to stay afloat when you&#39;re connected to others. Isolation is like trying to tread water alone—eventually, you sink.&quot;

— John Ortberg, adapted from <em>Everybody&#39;s Normal Till You Get to Know Them</em>
</blockquote>

Connection doesn&#39;t mean perfect harmony all the time. It means staying at the table even when conversations are hard. Staying in the community even when you&#39;re disappointed. Staying in relationship even when you&#39;re hurting.

Because isolation is where roots shrivel. Connection is where they deepen.

<strong>Forgiveness</strong> - Releasing what you can&#39;t control. Letting go of the need for justice, vindication, or revenge. Trusting God to make all things right in His time.

Forgiveness isn&#39;t a one-time decision. It&#39;s a daily practice. Sometimes an hourly practice. You choose to release the offense again and again until one day you realize it no longer has power over you.

This is the work of cultivating deep roots: putting to death what doesn&#39;t belong, cultivating what does. Not by addition, but by transformation.

<strong>3. The Tree by Streams of Water</strong>

The Psalmist paints a picture of flourishing that captures everything deep roots make possible:

<blockquote>
&quot;Blessed is the one
    who does not walk in step with the wicked
or stand in the way that sinners take
    or sit in the company of mockers,
but whose delight is in the law of the LORD,
    and who meditates on his law day and night.
That person is like a tree planted by streams of water,
    which yields its fruit in season
and whose leaf does not wither—
    whatever they do prospers.&quot;

— Psalm 1:1-3
</blockquote>

Notice the progression: The blessed person doesn&#39;t walk, stand, or sit with those who mock God. Instead, they delight in God&#39;s Word and meditate on it continually.

And the result? They&#39;re like a tree planted by streams of water.

<strong>Planted, not drifting.</strong> Intentional, rooted, stable. Not a tumbleweed blown wherever the wind takes it. You&#39;ve been planted by streams—the water&#39;s edge of grace. Now roots are growing deep.

<strong>Streams of water.</strong> The tree doesn&#39;t generate its own water. It&#39;s positioned by an abundant source. You don&#39;t generate your own grace. You&#39;re rooted in God&#39;s inexhaustible provision. The streams flow constantly. You access them through roots—prayer, Scripture, worship, community, Sabbath.

<strong>Fruit in season.</strong> Not all the time. Not constantly. In season. This is realistic spirituality. There are seasons of growth, seasons of fruit, seasons of dormancy, seasons of pruning. Deep roots don&#39;t guarantee constant productivity. They guarantee sustainable fruitfulness over time.

<strong>Leaf does not wither.</strong> Even in drought—hard seasons when surface moisture evaporates, when emotions are dry, when external supports fail—the deeply rooted tree endures. Why? Because deep roots access water others can&#39;t reach.

This is the stability deep roots offer: not exemption from hard seasons, but endurance through them.

<strong>Whatever they do prospers.</strong> Not prosperity gospel—not &quot;follow these steps, get these results.&quot; This is organic flourishing. A well-rooted tree naturally prospers because it&#39;s connected to its source.

Stay rooted. The fruit will come. Not forced. Not manufactured. Organic. In season.

<strong>4. The Promise of Jeremiah</strong>

The prophet Jeremiah expands this imagery with even stronger promises:

<blockquote>
&quot;But blessed is the one who trusts in the LORD,
    whose confidence is in him.
They will be like a tree planted by the water
    that sends out its roots by the stream.
It does not fear when heat comes;
    its leaves are always green.
It has no worries in a year of drought
    and never fails to bear fruit.&quot;

— Jeremiah 17:7-8
</blockquote>

Notice the difference from Psalm 1: Jeremiah emphasizes trust and resilience. Deep roots come from trusting the LORD—not your performance, not your circumstances, but God.

<strong>Trust as the foundation.</strong> Jeremiah contrasts two types of people: those who trust in humans (cursed, like a bush in parched desert) and those who trust in the LORD (blessed, like a tree by water). Your roots go where your trust is. If you trust yourself, roots stay shallow—limited by your capacity. If you trust God, roots go deep—accessing an infinite source.

<strong>Sends out roots.</strong> Active imagery. You don&#39;t passively wait for depth. You actively cultivate it through practices, through choices, through sustained rhythms. But the growth itself is organic, not forced.

<strong>Does not fear when heat comes.</strong> This is the promise: resilience. Heat—trials, suffering, hard seasons—will come. The question isn&#39;t if, but when. But deeply rooted trees don&#39;t fear the heat. Not because heat doesn&#39;t hurt, but because deep roots access water even when surface conditions are scorching.

<strong>No worries in drought.</strong> Not &quot;no awareness&quot;—the tree knows there&#39;s drought. But &quot;no anxiety.&quot; It sees withering all around but has no worries because its roots reach deep water. This is the unforced rhythm of trust: acknowledging hard realities without anxious striving.

<strong>Never fails to bear fruit.</strong> An even stronger promise than Psalm 1&#39;s &quot;fruit in season.&quot; Why? Because the tree is constantly connected to the stream. It&#39;s not dependent on rainfall (external circumstances). It&#39;s rooted by a stream (constant internal source).

When you&#39;re deeply rooted in God, you don&#39;t become fruitless in hard seasons. The fruit might look different—not abundance, but endurance; not productivity, but presence. But you never fail to bear it.

<strong>5. Rooted and Built Up in Christ</strong>

The apostle Paul gives practical instructions for how roots actually deepen:

<blockquote>
&quot;So then, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live your lives in him, rooted and built up in him, strengthened in the faith as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness.&quot;

— Colossians 2:6-7
</blockquote>

This is the process: receive, continue, be rooted, be built up, be strengthened, overflow.

<strong>As you received.</strong> Paul anchors growth in grace. You didn&#39;t earn salvation—you received it. Now live the same way. Don&#39;t shift from grace (how you were saved) to works (how you think you&#39;ll grow). Deep roots grow in the soil of grace, not striving.

<strong>Continue to live in him.</strong> The word &quot;continue&quot; suggests consistency—the unforced rhythms of the previous chapter. Not a one-time decision. Ongoing, daily, rhythmic living in Christ. Roots deepen through sustained connection, not sporadic effort.

<strong>Rooted and built up.</strong> Paul combines two metaphors: agricultural (rooted) and architectural (built up). Roots grow down—unseen, slow, deep. Buildings go up—visible, structured, intentional. Both are necessary. Deep roots provide stability for strong growth.

<strong>Strengthened in faith.</strong> Faith deepens through practice, teaching, community. You were &quot;taught&quot;—you didn&#39;t discover this alone. Deep roots grow in community, with mentors, through Scripture, with accountability.

<strong>Overflowing with thankfulness.</strong> The result of deep roots is overflow. Not scarcity—hoarding grace for yourself. But abundance—so rooted in God&#39;s love you overflow with gratitude. Thankfulness becomes the posture of the deeply rooted life.

<strong>6. The Disciplines as Roots</strong>

How do roots actually go deep? Through spiritual practices that position you in the stream of God&#39;s grace.

Jan Johnson writes about contemplative practices in <em>When the Soul Listens</em>:

<blockquote>
&quot;Spiritual disciplines are not tasks to check off a list. They are invitations to be with God. Prayer is not about saying the right words—it&#39;s about showing up. Scripture reading is not about covering chapters—it&#39;s about listening. Sabbath is not about rules—it&#39;s about rest. When we approach disciplines this way, they become life-giving rhythms rather than religious obligations.&quot;

— Jan Johnson, adapted from <em>When the Soul Listens</em>
</blockquote>

The spiritual disciplines—prayer, study, fasting, solitude, service, worship, Sabbath—are how you send roots deep. Not to earn God&#39;s favor. But to position yourself where grace can transform you.

<strong>Prayer</strong> - Not just asking for things, but cultivating awareness of God&#39;s presence. Learning to abide. To rest. To listen.

<strong>Scripture</strong> - Not just accumulating knowledge, but letting the Word renew your mind, shape your desires, reorder your loves.

<strong>Sabbath</strong> - Not just a day off, but a rhythm of rest that reminds you: you are not what you produce. You are beloved.

<strong>Solitude</strong> - Not isolation, but intentional time alone with God. Away from noise, hurry, and distraction. Space to hear His voice.

<strong>Community</strong> - Not performance, but authentic connection. Confession. Accountability. Mutual encouragement. Shared worship.

<strong>Service</strong> - Not to earn approval, but to overflow from abundance. Giving from what you&#39;ve received. Loving because you&#39;ve been loved.

These aren&#39;t rules to keep or hoops to jump through. They&#39;re the practices that create conditions for deep roots. You can&#39;t force roots to grow. But you can position yourself by the stream and let growth happen.

Adele Ahlberg Calhoun writes in <em>Spiritual Disciplines Handbook</em>:

<blockquote>
&quot;We cannot transform ourselves. But we can cooperate with God&#39;s transforming work. Spiritual disciplines are the means by which we place ourselves in the path of God&#39;s grace. They are how we say yes to the Spirit&#39;s work in us.&quot;

— Adele Ahlberg Calhoun, <em>Spiritual Disciplines Handbook</em>
</blockquote>

This is the work of deep roots: sustained, patient cooperation with God&#39;s grace. Not earning. Not striving. Positioning yourself. And trusting the growth to come.

<h2>Biblical Parallels</h2>

<strong>The Parable of the Sower (Matthew 13:1-23)</strong>

Jesus tells a story about a farmer scattering seed. Some falls on the path and birds eat it. Some falls on rocky ground—it sprouts quickly but withers because it has no root. Some falls among thorns that choke it. And some falls on good soil and produces a crop—thirty, sixty, even a hundred times what was sown.

Jesus explains: The seed is the Word of God. The soils represent different responses.

The rocky ground is particularly relevant to this chapter:

<blockquote>
&quot;The seed falling on rocky ground refers to someone who hears the word and at once receives it with joy. But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.&quot;

— Matthew 13:20-21
</blockquote>

No root. That&#39;s the problem. Enthusiasm without depth. Emotion without foundation. The person receives the Word with joy—there&#39;s initial excitement, genuine response. But when heat comes, they wither. Why? No root.

This is the warning of Chapter 10: don&#39;t settle for surface-level faith. Don&#39;t mistake initial enthusiasm for deep transformation. Send roots deep now—through sustained practices, patient trust, consistent rhythms—so when heat comes (and it will), you don&#39;t wither.

The good soil represents those who &quot;hear the word, accept it, and produce a crop&quot; (Mark 4:20). But even good soil requires cultivation. Weeding. Watering. Tending. The disciplines are how you cultivate the soil of your soul so roots can go deep and fruit can come.

<strong>The Vine and the Branches (John 15:1-8)</strong>

Jesus uses agricultural imagery to describe the Christian life:

<blockquote>
&quot;I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.&quot;

— John 15:5
</blockquote>

The key word is &quot;remain&quot;—or in other translations, &quot;abide.&quot; This is the language of roots. Branches don&#39;t try to produce fruit. They remain connected to the vine. And fruit happens naturally.

You don&#39;t manufacture fruit through effort. You remain connected to Jesus through sustained practices of prayer, Scripture, worship, community. And fruit—love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control (Galatians 5:22-23)—grows organically.

But remaining requires intentionality. Branches can be cut off. They can be pruned. They can wither if they don&#39;t stay connected to the vine.

The unforced rhythms of grace aren&#39;t passive. They&#39;re active cooperation with God&#39;s life flowing into you. You position yourself. You remain. You abide. And the fruit comes.

<strong>The Fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23)</strong>

Paul contrasts the works of the flesh (what happens when you live from False Self, from striving, from performance) with the fruit of the Spirit (what happens when you live from True Self, from belovedness, from grace):

<blockquote>
&quot;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law.&quot;

— Galatians 5:22-23
</blockquote>

Notice: it&#39;s fruit, not works. Works are produced through effort. Fruit grows organically when you&#39;re connected to the source.

This is the promise of deep roots: not that you&#39;ll have to try harder to be loving, joyful, peaceful, patient. But that as you remain connected to Jesus—as your roots go deep into His love—these qualities will grow naturally.

Not overnight. Not all at once. But in season. Over time. Through the slow, organic work of roots reaching down to streams of living water.

<strong>The Tree Planted by Water (Ezekiel 47:12)</strong>

Ezekiel has a vision of water flowing from the temple, bringing life wherever it goes. And along the banks of this river:

<blockquote>
&quot;Fruit trees of all kinds will grow on both banks of the river. Their leaves will not wither, nor will their fruit fail. Every month they will bear fruit, because the water from the sanctuary flows to them. Their fruit will serve for food and their leaves for healing.&quot;

— Ezekiel 47:12
</blockquote>

This is the eschatological vision—the ultimate flourishing. But it&#39;s also the pattern for now: trees planted by streams of living water, bearing fruit, leaves for healing.

The water from the sanctuary flows to them. You don&#39;t generate your own life. You&#39;re positioned by the stream of God&#39;s grace. And as that grace flows to you—through prayer, Scripture, worship, community, Sabbath—you bear fruit. Your life becomes food for others. Your presence brings healing.

This is what deep roots make possible.

<h2>Theological Anchor</h2>

<blockquote>
&quot;I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing. If you do not remain in me, you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned. If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. This is to my Father&#39;s glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples.&quot;

— John 15:5-8
</blockquote>

This is Jesus&#39;s teaching on remaining—on abiding. And it&#39;s the theological foundation for everything this chapter teaches about deep roots.

<strong>&quot;I am the vine; you are the branches.&quot;</strong>

The relationship is organic, not mechanical. Not master and servant. Not employer and employee. Vine and branches. Living connection. Shared life. The sap that flows through the vine flows through the branches. The life that sustains the vine sustains the branches.

You&#39;re not disconnected from Jesus, trying to imitate Him from a distance. You&#39;re connected to Jesus, sharing His life.

<strong>&quot;If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit.&quot;</strong>

The condition is remaining. Not striving. Not performing. Not white-knuckling your way to holiness. Remaining. Abiding. Staying connected.

And the promise is fruit. Not because you&#39;re trying to produce it. But because life is flowing from the vine into the branches. The fruit is inevitable when the connection is sustained.

<strong>&quot;Apart from me you can do nothing.&quot;</strong>

This is both humbling and liberating. Humbling because it reminds you: you&#39;re not the source. You can&#39;t generate spiritual life through your own effort. Liberating because it takes the pressure off. You don&#39;t have to produce. You just have to remain.

Eugene Peterson writes about this invitation in his translation of Matthew 11:28-30:

<blockquote>
&quot;Are you tired? Worn out? Burned out on religion? Come to me. Get away with me and you&#39;ll recover your life. I&#39;ll show you how to take a real rest. Walk with me and work with me—watch how I do it. Learn the unforced rhythms of grace. I won&#39;t lay anything heavy or ill-fitting on you. Keep company with me and you&#39;ll learn to live freely and lightly.&quot;

— Matthew 11:28-30, The Message
</blockquote>

Unforced rhythms. That&#39;s the key. Not forced striving. Not rigid rules. Not exhausting performance. Unforced—natural, sustainable, flowing. Rhythms—repeating patterns, not one-time efforts. Of grace—sourced in God&#39;s love, not your striving.

<strong>&quot;If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish.&quot;</strong>

Remaining isn&#39;t just emotional closeness. It&#39;s also letting Jesus&#39;s words dwell in you. Meditating on Scripture. Letting it shape your thinking, reorder your desires, renew your mind.

As you remain and His words remain, your prayers change. You stop asking for what you want and start asking for what He wants. And those prayers are answered because they&#39;re aligned with His will.

<strong>&quot;This is to my Father&#39;s glory, that you bear much fruit.&quot;</strong>

The goal isn&#39;t your glory. It&#39;s the Father&#39;s. When you bear fruit—when love, joy, peace, patience, kindness grow in you—people see it and give glory to God. Not because you&#39;re amazing. Because God&#39;s grace is transforming you.

This is the theological anchor: remain in Jesus. Let His words remain in you. And fruit will come—not forced, but organic. Not manufactured, but received. Not through your effort, but through your abiding.

Deep roots make abiding possible. And abiding makes fruit inevitable.

<h2>The Wayfarer Moment</h2>

<strong>Learning to trust the hidden work.</strong>

For years, I equated spiritual growth with visible progress. I wanted to see results. Measure outcomes. Track my advancement. If I couldn&#39;t see it, I questioned whether anything was actually happening.

But roots don&#39;t work that way.

The most important growth happens underground. Unseen. Unmeasured. Unremarkable to anyone watching.

Above ground, a tree might look unchanged for months. But below ground, roots are spreading, reaching, deepening. And that hidden work is what makes everything else possible.

I learned this the hard way. After coming out of the swamp, after encountering grace at the water&#39;s edge, I wanted instant transformation. I wanted to be different immediately—healed, whole, bearing fruit.

But God was growing roots.

There were days when I felt like nothing was changing. I&#39;d pray and feel nothing. Read Scripture and feel unmoved. Gather with community and still feel alone.

But looking back now, I can see what was happening. Roots were going deep. Not dramatically. Not visibly. But steadily. Through sustained practices. Through showing up even when I didn&#39;t feel like it. Through choosing connection over isolation. Through releasing bitterness and cultivating forgiveness.

The wayfarer moment came when I stopped measuring my progress by what I could see and started trusting the hidden work God was doing.

I stopped asking, &quot;Why aren&#39;t I different yet?&quot; and started asking, &quot;Am I remaining in Him? Are my roots going deeper?&quot;

Because here&#39;s what I&#39;ve learned: surface-level change happens fast but doesn&#39;t last. Deep transformation happens slowly but endures.

You can manufacture behavior change through willpower. But it won&#39;t last. The first time stress hits, the first time temptation comes, you&#39;ll revert to old patterns.

But deep roots—roots that reach down to streams of living water—create lasting stability. Not perfection. But resilience. Not arrival. But endurance.

I still have hard days. Days when I&#39;m reactive instead of responsive. Days when I choose isolation over connection. Days when bitterness resurfaces and I have to forgive again.

But I don&#39;t panic anymore. Because I know: the roots are there. They&#39;re deep. And even when I can&#39;t see growth above ground, there&#39;s work happening below.

This is the invitation: trust the hidden work. Keep showing up. Keep practicing the disciplines. Keep remaining in Jesus. The fruit will come. In season. When roots are ready.

<h2>Original Writing from the Blog</h2>

<strong>Psalm 1: Interpretation for Today&#39;s Life</strong>

Blessed is the one who refuses to press the Easy button by following the ways of the wicked rather than taking the path of integrity and hard work

Blessed is the one who avoids temptations of the wicked, like…
…Cheating on my taxes by submitting false documentation and using the excuse &quot;The Government owes me this&quot;
…Short changing the cashier when I know I was given too much change in return, resulting in a shortage in their cash drawer to be reconciled and flippantly using the excuse &quot;That&#39;s their loss, my gain&quot;
…Taking credit for someone else&#39;s accomplishments to make me look better, rather than speaking the truth and giving credit where credit is due and using the excuse &quot;I did most of the work anyway and I deserve the credit&quot;
…Covering up my own mistakes by blaming someone else behind their back and using the excuse &quot;They never do anything worthwhile and this wasn&#39;t my fault&quot;
…Taking it out on another in fits of anger or other types of control and using the excuse &quot;They never help me out when I need it or give me a break; I&#39;m always bailing them out&quot;
…Not trusting you God with my brokenness and failures, and instead turning to addictive behaviors using the excuse &quot;I can solve my own problems; and, God wouldn&#39;t help me anyway&quot;
…Making myself out to be more important than you God, and thus committing the vilest of sin using the excuse &quot;Who are you God that I would trust you with my problems? You never answer my prayers. I&#39;ll fix it myself&quot;

Bless us Lord instead when we thirst for your Words of life and meditate on them day and night
Bless us when we sing praises and pray to you in our cars on the way to work or school or during our morning devotion
Bless us when we pray for others and when we lift them up to you on their behalf

Plant us and root us in your Words, like a tree next to a stream of water soaking up the deep waters of life
Let our leaves flourish and never wither
May our trunk grow strong to withstand life&#39;s storms and the never ending attacks of the wicked
May you prosper all of our activities…
…In our interactions with family and friends and our coworkers
…With every conversation we have with those as we go about our day that they may see You living within us
…When we are thankful and gracious to those around us and can see when someone needs encouragement in their day
…When we offer forgiveness to those who hurt us and when we are quick to say we are sorry when we hurt others
…When we do not pass up any opportunity to do a kind deed to the least of these among us

May we not be like paper rubbish blown hither and yonder in the wind like the wicked who have no direction or purpose but of themselves
May we not stand condemned in the judgement but remain strong in the assembly of the righteous
Watch over us, oh Lord, in our walk of righteousness
And keep us from the destructive ways of the wicked
For you are our God
Glory to God in the highest

Amen

<h2>Song Integration</h2>

This writing came from reflecting on Psalm 1 during a season when I was learning what it means to be rooted. To be planted, not drifting. To draw life from God&#39;s Word rather than from the world&#39;s shallow streams.

I was struck by the psalm&#39;s contrast: the wicked are like chaff—lightweight, blown about by wind, no substance. But the righteous are like trees—rooted, stable, fruitful.

I&#39;d spent too many years as chaff. Blown by others&#39; opinions. Shaped by cultural pressures. Reactive to circumstances. No roots. No stability. No depth.

But God was inviting me to something different. To be planted. To send roots deep into His Word, His love, His presence. To become the kind of person who could withstand storms because I was anchored in Him.

This interpretation of Psalm 1 was my way of wrestling with what that means practically. Not just theologically. Not just theoretically. But in the daily choices of life.

What does it look like to be rooted in God&#39;s Word when temptation comes? When shortcuts are available? When everyone else is cutting corners and I could too?

What does it look like to be a tree by streams of water when the culture around me is chaff—drifting, rootless, searching for meaning in all the wrong places?

The answer, I discovered, isn&#39;t trying harder to be good. It&#39;s staying rooted. Meditating on God&#39;s Word. Praying continually. Practicing presence. Choosing integrity even when no one&#39;s watching.

Because deep roots produce strong growth. Not overnight. But over time. In season. When the roots are ready.

<h3>Song: &quot;I Will Trust You Lord&quot;</h3>

<strong>Verse 1:</strong>
I will trust You, Lord, my shelter, my song
Planted by Your stream, where my roots grow strong
When the heat is near, still my leaves stay bright
In the darkest storm, You will be my light

<strong>Pre-Chorus:</strong>
Oh, my heart is grounded deep in Your grace
Anchored in Your presence, I will stand in faith

<strong>Chorus:</strong>
Like a tree beside the river, I will stand so tall

My leaves stay green, my soul stays strong
Your love sustains me all life long
I will bear Your fruit, Lord, make me new
I am deeply rooted in You

<strong>Verse 2:</strong>
I will drink Your Word, let it fill my soul
Day and night I&#39;ll seek You, Lord, You make me whole
When the winds arise, I will not be swayed
For my roots run deep, I will not be afraid

<strong>Pre-Chorus:</strong>
Oh, my heart is grounded deep in Your grace
Anchored in Your presence, I will stand in faith

<strong>Chorus:</strong>

Deeply rooted, never shaken
By Your love, I stand so strong
Deeply rooted, always faithful
In Your hands, I belong

<h2>Reflections for the Road</h2>

These aren&#39;t assignments to complete. They&#39;re invitations to deepen your roots.

<strong>Questions for the Journey:</strong>

<ol>
<li><strong>What needs to die so roots can go deep?</strong>

Look honestly at your life. Where is pride keeping you shallow? Where is reactivity preventing growth? Where is isolation cutting you off from community? Where is bitterness poisoning the soil?

Name it. Bring it to God. Ask for grace to let it die.
</li>
<li><strong>What practices position you by the stream?</strong>

What are the rhythms that connect you to God? Prayer? Scripture? Sabbath? Solitude? Worship? Community?

Are you practicing them consistently? Or sporadically? Deep roots require sustained connection, not occasional effort.
</li>
<li><strong>Where are you trying to manufacture fruit instead of remaining in the vine?</strong>

Are you striving to be more loving? Trying harder to be joyful? White-knuckling your way to peace?

Fruit doesn&#39;t come from trying harder. It comes from remaining in Jesus. Are you abiding? Or are you achieving?
</li>
<li><strong>What does &quot;fruit in season&quot; mean for you right now?</strong>

Not every season is fruitful. Some seasons are for growth. Some for pruning. Some for rest. Some for harvest.

What season are you in? Can you trust that God is at work even if you don&#39;t see visible fruit right now?
</li>
<li><strong>Read Psalm 1 and Jeremiah 17:7-8 slowly. What is God saying to you through these images?</strong>

Don&#39;t rush. Meditate. Let the imagery sink in. What does it look like for you to be a tree planted by streams of water?
</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>Practice: Cultivating Deep Roots</h2>

Here&#39;s a simple framework for sending roots deep through spiritual disciplines:

<strong>1. Daily: Drink from the stream</strong>

Choose one practice that connects you to God daily:

<ul>
<li>Morning prayer and Scripture reading</li>
<li>Lectio divina (prayerful Scripture meditation)</li>
<li>Journaling prayers</li>
<li>Listening prayer in silence</li>
</ul>

The practice matters less than the consistency. You&#39;re training your roots to reach for the stream every day.

<strong>2. Weekly: Sabbath rest</strong>

Set aside one day (or even a few hours) each week for Sabbath. Not as legalism. As gift.

Sabbath isn&#39;t about what you stop doing. It&#39;s about what you start receiving. Stop striving so you can receive rest. Stop producing so you can receive belovedness. Stop proving so you can receive grace.

Ruth Haley Barton writes in <em>Sacred Rhythms</em>:

<blockquote>
&quot;Sabbath is the most countercultural practice available to us. It is a fundamental way of expressing trust in God&#39;s provision. When we cease our labors, we acknowledge that God is the provider, not us.&quot;

— Ruth Haley Barton, <em>Sacred Rhythms</em>
</blockquote>

<strong>3. Monthly: Solitude and silence</strong>

Once a month, create extended space for solitude. A few hours. A half day. A full day if possible.

Not just quiet time. Solitude—intentional time alone with God. Away from noise, hurry, screens, people.

What do you do in solitude? Nothing. And everything. You listen. You rest. You let God search your heart. You pay attention to what&#39;s happening in your soul.

<strong>4. Seasonally: Examine your roots</strong>

Every few months, review: Are my roots going deeper? Or am I staying shallow?

Ask:

<ul>
<li>Am I more reactive or more responsive than I was six months ago?</li>
<li>Am I more isolated or more connected?</li>
<li>Am I more bitter or more forgiving?</li>
<li>Am I more prideful or more humble?</li>
</ul>

This isn&#39;t about shame. It&#39;s about awareness. Where do roots need to go deeper? What needs to die? What needs to be cultivated?

<strong>5. Community: Grow in groves</strong>

Trees don&#39;t grow in isolation. Their roots intertwine with other roots, creating stability and sharing nutrients.

You need community. Real community. Not performative. Not surface-level. But authentic connection where you can:

<ul>
<li>Confess struggles</li>
<li>Receive prayer</li>
<li>Offer encouragement</li>
<li>Practice forgiveness</li>
<li>Serve together</li>
<li>Worship together</li>
</ul>

Who are your people? Who knows your real struggles? Who prays for you by name? Who holds you accountable with grace?

Deep roots grow in community.

<hr>

<h2>Closing Image</h2>

You&#39;re standing at the base of an ancient tree. Massive. Towering. Its canopy spreads wide, providing shade for acres.

How long has this tree been here? A hundred years? Two hundred? More?

You walk closer and place your hand on the trunk. Solid. Rough. Weathered by countless storms. Scarred by lightning strikes. Marked by seasons of growth and seasons of pruning.

But still standing.

You look up into the branches. Birds nest there. Squirrels scamper. Life thrives in the shelter this tree provides.

And then you look down. At the base. Where roots disappear into the earth.

You can&#39;t see them. But you know they&#39;re there. Reaching deep. Spreading wide. Anchoring this massive tree so firmly that no storm can topple it.

The roots are why the tree stands.

Not the visible trunk. Not the impressive canopy. Not the beautiful fruit.

The roots.

Hidden. Unseen. Unremarkable to anyone walking by.

But essential.

This is the invitation: send your roots deep. Not for show. Not for applause. Not even for immediate fruit.

For stability. For resilience. For sustainable life.

The work happens underground. In the quiet. In the daily practices. In the sustained rhythms. In the patient trust.

You won&#39;t always see results. You won&#39;t always feel growth. You won&#39;t always sense progress.

But if you remain—if you keep showing up, keep practicing the disciplines, keep choosing connection over isolation, keep releasing bitterness and cultivating forgiveness—the roots will go deep.

And when heat comes (and it will come), you won&#39;t fear.

When drought arrives (and it will arrive), you won&#39;t worry.

When storms rage (and they will rage), you won&#39;t be uprooted.

Because your roots—hidden, deep, sustained by streams of living water—will hold.

And in season, when roots are ready, fruit will come.

Not forced. Not manufactured. Not through exhausting effort.

Organic. Natural. Inevitable.

Because you remained. You abided. You sent roots deep.

Like a tree planted by streams of water.

Leaves green. Fruit in season. Soul strong.

Deeply rooted in the love of God.

And that makes all the difference.

<h3>MOVEMENT 3: UNFORCED RHYTHMS (The Transformation)</h3>

<h3>Chapter 9: Unforced Rhythms of Grace</h3>

[audio src="https://www.skylerthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Mindful-Bliss-Male.mp3"]
There&#39;s a pattern most of us fall into after experiencing dramatic grace: we try to keep the intensity going.

We expect every day to feel like the day we left the swamp. Every prayer to carry the weight of that first desperate cry. Every moment with God to match the power of that initial encounter.

And when it doesn&#39;t—when faith settles into something quieter, less dramatic, more ordinary—we panic. We think we&#39;re losing it. Backsliding. Cooling off. So we try harder. Push for the feeling. Manufacture the intensity. Force the experience.

But here&#39;s what you&#39;re discovering: grace isn&#39;t meant to be lived in constant crisis mode.

Grace offers something better than perpetual intensity.

It offers rhythm.

Jesus called it &quot;unforced rhythms of grace.&quot; Not frenzy. Not performance. Not the exhausting cycle of fall-and-rescue, fall-and-rescue. But rhythm. Pattern. A sustainable way of walking with God that actually fits with how you&#39;re made.

This chapter is about making the shift from dramatic intervention to daily rhythm. From peak experiences to sustainable presence. From surviving crises to thriving in ordinary faithfulness.

The writing that follows came from my discovery that grace isn&#39;t just the rescue—it&#39;s also the walk. The daily bread. The morning-by-morning manna.

The unforced way of living that doesn&#39;t burn out because it was never built on hype in the first place.

<hr>

<h2>Key Themes</h2>

<strong>1. The Set Point Theory: Sustainable Foundations</strong>

There&#39;s a concept in psychology called the &quot;set point&quot; theory of happiness. It suggests that each of us has a baseline level of well-being—a natural temperament that&#39;s relatively stable over time. Our daily experiences create fluctuations around that baseline: some days we&#39;re up, some days we&#39;re down. But we tend to return to our set point.

This matters for understanding grace because grace doesn&#39;t promise constant emotional highs. Doesn&#39;t promise that every day will feel like a mountaintop experience.

Grace offers something better: a stable foundation beneath the fluctuations.

Not hype, but home.
Not peak experiences, but sustainable presence.
Not manufactured intensity, but authentic rhythm.

You can have a hard day and still be grounded in grace. You can feel sad and still be held by God. You can experience disappointment, frustration, even anger—and still be living in the unforced rhythms of grace.

Because grace isn&#39;t about eliminating life&#39;s natural ups and downs. It&#39;s about providing the steady baseline—the set point—from which you experience them.

Ruth Haley Barton writes in <em>Sacred Rhythms</em>:

<blockquote>
&quot;Spiritual transformation takes place as we are willing to open ourselves to the Spirit of God in our everyday lives. The problem is that everyday life is so daily... What we need are rhythms and routines that create openings in our lives where transformation can take place. We need spiritual practices that enable us to be present to God&#39;s transforming work within us.&quot;

— Ruth Haley Barton, <em>Sacred Rhythms</em>
</blockquote>

Unforced rhythms don&#39;t mean effortless. They mean sustainable. They mean working with your natural design rather than against it. They mean grace-paced rather than performance-driven.

<strong>2. The Manna Experience: Daily Bread, Daily Grace</strong>

When Israel wandered in the wilderness, God provided manna—bread from heaven—every single morning. But there were rules: gather only what you need for today. Don&#39;t try to hoard it for tomorrow. Trust that tomorrow will have its own provision.

When Israel first saw it, they said &quot;Man hu?&quot;—&quot;What is it?&quot; The question mark. They didn&#39;t recognize God&#39;s provision because it didn&#39;t look like what they expected.

But day after day, as they gathered it and ate it and were sustained by it, the question mark changed to an exclamation mark. &quot;This is God&#39;s provision! This is grace made tangible!&quot;

The Book of Revelation speaks of &quot;hidden manna&quot; given to the one who overcomes (Revelation 2:17)—bread from heaven, daily sustenance, grace in rhythm.

Living in unforced rhythms means participating in a manna experience:

<ul>
<li>You don&#39;t have to figure out next month&#39;s provision today</li>
<li>You just gather today&#39;s manna</li>
<li>You trust tomorrow will have its own</li>
<li>You don&#39;t hoard grace; you receive it fresh each morning</li>
</ul>

This is what Jesus taught His disciples to pray: &quot;Give us this day our daily bread.&quot; Not weekly bread. Not monthly bread. Daily bread.

Because grace is meant to be received in rhythm—morning by morning, day by day.

<strong>3. Survival vs. Thriving: From Crisis to Cultivation</strong>

There&#39;s a fundamental difference between surviving and thriving. Many of us have been in survival mode so long, we&#39;ve forgotten what thriving looks like.

Survival is getting through. Thriving is growing in.
Survival is crisis management. Thriving is intentional cultivation.
Survival asks &quot;How do I make it through today?&quot;
Thriving asks &quot;What kind of life do I want to build?&quot;

In the swamp, survival was the only option. You were just trying to breathe, to keep your head above water, to make it through one more day.

At the water&#39;s edge, you moved from crisis to cleansing. You were still focused on immediate needs—getting clean, finding healing, experiencing rescue.

But in the unforced rhythms of grace, you&#39;re learning to thrive. You&#39;re not just reacting to crises anymore. You&#39;re building a sustainable life. You&#39;re asking different questions:

<ul>
<li>What do I want to see MORE of in my life?</li>
<li>What do I want to see LESS of?</li>
<li>What do I want NOT AT ALL anymore?</li>
</ul>

From these questions come projects, goals, plans. Not frantic New Year&#39;s resolutions that set you up for failure. But grace-paced renewal that leads to transformation.

Parker Palmer writes in <em>Let Your Life Speak</em>:

<blockquote>
&quot;Before you tell your life what you intend to do with it, listen for what it intends to do with you. Before you tell your life what truths and values you have decided to live up to, let your life tell you what truths you embody, what values you represent.&quot;

— Parker Palmer, <em>Let Your Life Speak</em>
</blockquote>

Thriving means learning to listen. To pay attention to the rhythms that bring life. To notice what drains you and what sustains you.

Then to build a life—intentionally, gradually, grace-paced—around the rhythms that lead to flourishing.

<strong>4. Sabbath Principles: Rhythms, Not Rules</strong>

Jesus said something revolutionary about Sabbath: &quot;The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath&quot; (Mark 2:27).

The religious leaders of His day had turned Sabbath into a burden. An endless list of rules about what you couldn&#39;t do. A test you could fail.

But Jesus reclaimed Sabbath as a gift. A rhythm. A pattern designed for human flourishing.

Sabbath isn&#39;t primarily about what you stop doing. It&#39;s about what you start receiving.

You stop striving so you can start resting.
You stop producing so you can start being.
You stop proving your worth so you can start remembering your belovedness.

This is the heart of unforced rhythms: they&#39;re designed for your good. They&#39;re not arbitrary rules imposed by an austere God to see if you&#39;ll comply.

They&#39;re life-giving patterns woven into the fabric of creation because God knows how you&#39;re made and what you need to thrive.

Gerald May writes in <em>The Awakened Heart</em>:

<blockquote>
&quot;We are accustomed to thinking of spiritual practice as something we do on our own initiative... But grace is always inviting us into relationship, and the invitation is unforced. There is no coercion in love.&quot;

— Gerald May, <em>The Awakened Heart</em>
</blockquote>

Unforced. That word matters. The rhythms of grace aren&#39;t imposed. They&#39;re invited. They don&#39;t force you into a mold. They free you to become who you actually are.

<strong>5. Jesus&#39; Own Rhythms: Withdrawal and Engagement</strong>

If you want to understand unforced rhythms, watch Jesus. He&#39;s the master of sustainable spiritual life. He never burned out. Never collapsed under the weight of ministry. Never lost His connection to the Father.

How?

Rhythm.

Mark 1:35 captures it perfectly:

<blockquote>
&quot;Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed.&quot;
</blockquote>

This wasn&#39;t a one-time event. It was His pattern. His rhythm. Withdrawal and engagement. Solitude and community. Prayer and action. Rest and work.

Jesus would pour Himself out in ministry—teaching, healing, casting out demons, engaging with crowds. Then He would withdraw. To a solitary place. To pray. To reconnect with the Father. To be refilled.

He didn&#39;t wait until He was empty. He maintained the rhythm.

Engagement. Withdrawal. Engagement. Withdrawal.

Because He lived in this rhythm, He had something to give. Not out of duty. Not out of obligation.

Out of overflow.

Barbara Brown Taylor writes in <em>An Altar in the World</em>:

<blockquote>
&quot;The practice of Sabbath is one of those commanding us to stop. Stop working. Stop wanting. Stop worrying. Just stop and notice that you are more than your accomplishments, more than your to-do list, more than your bank account.&quot;

— Barbara Brown Taylor, <em>An Altar in the World</em>
</blockquote>

Jesus models this for us. Stop. Withdraw. Rest. Reconnect. And from that place of fullness, engage again.

This is sustainable. This is the rhythm of grace.

<strong>6. The Invitation to Easy and Light</strong>

Jesus issues one of the most beautiful invitations in all of Scripture in Matthew 11:28-30:

<blockquote>
&quot;Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.&quot;
</blockquote>

Read that again slowly. Jesus doesn&#39;t say, &quot;Try harder.&quot; He says, &quot;Come and rest.&quot;

He doesn&#39;t say, &quot;Pull yourself together.&quot; He says, &quot;I am gentle and humble in heart.&quot;

He doesn&#39;t say, &quot;My expectations are higher than anyone else&#39;s.&quot; He says, &quot;My yoke is easy and my burden is light.&quot;

This is scandalous to those of us who&#39;ve been trained in performance-based faith. We&#39;ve been taught that real discipleship is hard. Demanding. Exhausting. That if you&#39;re not burning out for Jesus, you&#39;re not doing it right.

But Jesus says the opposite. Real discipleship—life lived in the unforced rhythms of grace—is easy and light. Not effortless. Not without challenge. But sustainable. Fitting. Right-sized for human beings who need sleep and food and rest and rhythm.

Henri Nouwen captures this in <em>The Return of the Prodigal Son</em>:

<blockquote>
&quot;I have always been complaining that my work was constantly interrupted, until I slowly discovered that my interruptions were my work... I am beginning now to recognize that the real &#39;work of my work&#39; is to receive God&#39;s blessing each day anew and to let that blessing guide me in my daily life.&quot;

— Henri Nouwen, <em>The Return of the Prodigal Son</em>
</blockquote>

The work isn&#39;t producing. The work is receiving. Receiving God&#39;s blessing. Receiving daily bread. Receiving grace in rhythm.

That&#39;s the yoke that&#39;s easy. The burden that&#39;s light. The rhythm that&#39;s unforced.

<hr>

<h2>Biblical Parallels</h2>

<strong>The Manna in the Wilderness (Exodus 16:4-31)</strong>

When Israel was wandering in the wilderness, God provided manna every morning. But the provision came with a pattern—a rhythm they had to learn:

<blockquote>
&quot;Then the LORD said to Moses, &#39;I will rain down bread from heaven for you. The people are to go out each day and gather enough for that day. In this way I will test them and see whether they will follow my instructions.&#39;&quot;

— Exodus 16:4
</blockquote>

Each day. Not each week. Not each month. Each day. This was a test, but not the kind we usually think of. It wasn&#39;t a test of their ability to perform. It was a test of their willingness to trust.

Could they gather only what they needed for today and trust that tomorrow would have its own provision?

Some couldn&#39;t. They tried to hoard manna for the next day, and it rotted. They tried to control tomorrow&#39;s provision, and it turned to worms.

But those who learned the rhythm—gather today&#39;s manna, trust tomorrow&#39;s will come—were sustained. Day after day. Year after year. Bread from heaven in daily rhythm.

This is the pattern of unforced rhythms. Not control. Trust. Not hoarding. Receiving. Not anxiety about tomorrow. Faith that God&#39;s mercies are new every morning.

<strong>Elijah&#39;s Rhythm of Rest and Engagement (1 Kings 19:1-18)</strong>

Elijah had just experienced one of the greatest spiritual victories in Israel&#39;s history. He&#39;d called down fire from heaven. He&#39;d defeated the prophets of Baal. He&#39;d proven God&#39;s power before the entire nation.

And then he crashed.

Jezebel threatened his life, and Elijah ran into the wilderness, sat under a tree, and prayed to die: &quot;I have had enough, LORD. Take my life&quot; (1 Kings 19:4).

God&#39;s response is instructive. He didn&#39;t rebuke Elijah for his weakness. He didn&#39;t say, &quot;Pull yourself together—you just won a great victory!&quot; He didn&#39;t demand that Elijah get back to work.

Instead, God gave him what he needed: rest, food, and time.

An angel appeared and said, &quot;Get up and eat.&quot; Twice. And Elijah slept. And ate. And rested. For forty days.

Only after that—after Elijah had been physically and emotionally restored—did God speak to him in the gentle whisper and give him his next assignment.

God honored the rhythm. Work. Rest. Engagement. Withdrawal. Victory. Recovery.

Elijah had been running on adrenaline and spiritual intensity. God invited him into sustainable rhythm.

<strong>The Sabbath Rest (Genesis 2:2-3; Mark 2:27)</strong>

The pattern of Sabbath is woven into creation itself. On the seventh day, God rested. Not because He was tired. But to establish a pattern. A rhythm. Six days of work. One day of rest.

This isn&#39;t arbitrary. It&#39;s design. God made you to need rest. To need rhythm. To need patterns of engagement and withdrawal, work and Sabbath.

When the religious leaders tried to turn Sabbath into a legalistic burden, Jesus reclaimed it:

<blockquote>
&quot;The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.&quot;

— Mark 2:27
</blockquote>

Sabbath is a gift. A rhythm designed for your flourishing. It&#39;s not about rule-keeping. It&#39;s about soul-keeping.

<strong>The Rhythm of Green Pastures and Still Waters (Psalm 23:1-3)</strong>

The most beloved psalm in Scripture captures the rhythm of grace:

<blockquote>
&quot;The LORD is my shepherd, I lack nothing. He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters, he refreshes my soul.&quot;

— Psalm 23:1-3
</blockquote>

Notice the verbs. He makes me lie down. He leads me. He refreshes.

This isn&#39;t something you achieve. It&#39;s something you receive. The Shepherd knows you need green pastures—places to rest. He knows you need quiet waters—places to be refreshed. And He leads you there. Not through frantic striving. But through gentle guidance into the rhythms that restore your soul.

<hr>

<h2>Theological Anchor</h2>

<blockquote>
&quot;Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.&quot;

— Matthew 11:28-30
</blockquote>

This is Jesus&#39; manifesto for sustainable spiritual life. Let&#39;s unpack it:

<strong>&quot;Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened&quot;</strong>

Jesus&#39; invitation is not to the strong, the capable, the ones who have it all together. It&#39;s to the exhausted. The burned out. The ones carrying loads they were never meant to carry.

If you&#39;re tired—not just physically tired, but soul-tired—you&#39;re exactly who Jesus is calling.

<strong>&quot;I will give you rest&quot;</strong>

Not &quot;I will give you more work.&quot; Not &quot;I will give you higher standards.&quot; Not &quot;I will give you a more demanding discipleship.&quot;

Rest. Real rest. Soul rest. The kind of rest that comes not from escaping responsibility but from living in rhythm with grace.

<strong>&quot;Take my yoke upon you&quot;</strong>

A yoke is a working tool. Jesus isn&#39;t calling you to quit everything and retreat from life. He&#39;s calling you to work—but to work in partnership with Him. To let Him set the pace. To let Him carry the weight. To work in His strength, not your own.

<strong>&quot;Learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart&quot;</strong>

The teacher matters. Jesus doesn&#39;t drive you with shame. Doesn&#39;t demand perfection. Doesn&#39;t measure your worth by your productivity.

He is gentle. Humble. Patient. And as you learn from Him—as you watch His rhythms, adopt His patterns, live in His pace—you discover a different way of being.

<strong>&quot;You will find rest for your souls&quot;</strong>

Not just physical rest. Soul rest. The deep, abiding peace that comes from living in alignment with how you were made. From walking in the unforced rhythms of grace.

<strong>&quot;My yoke is easy and my burden is light&quot;</strong>

Easy doesn&#39;t mean effortless. It means well-fitting. Like a yoke custom-made for the ox wearing it. Jesus&#39; way of life fits you. It&#39;s designed for human beings. It&#39;s sustainable.

Light doesn&#39;t mean weightless. It means right-sized. Not crushing. Not overwhelming. Bearable. In fact, more than bearable—life-giving.

Dallas Willard writes in <em>The Great Omission</em>:

<blockquote>
&quot;Grace is not opposed to effort, it is opposed to earning. Earning is an attitude. Effort is an action... Grace is opposed to earning. Grace is not opposed to effort. Grace is God&#39;s freely given presence and help.&quot;

— Dallas Willard, <em>The Great Omission</em>
</blockquote>

Unforced rhythms don&#39;t mean no effort. They mean effort aligned with grace. Work done in partnership with God. Striving that flows from rest rather than striving to earn rest.

This is the theological foundation: Jesus invites us into a sustainable way of living where we work from rest, not for rest. Where we labor in rhythm with grace, not against it. Where our souls find the deep rest that comes from being yoked to the One who is gentle and humble in heart.

<h2>The Wayfarer Moment</h2>

<strong>The shift from frenzy to rhythm doesn&#39;t happen all at once. It happens one choice at a time.</strong>

For years, I lived in frenzy. Crisis mode. Always reacting. Always behind. Always exhausted. I thought that&#39;s what faithfulness looked like—burning out for Jesus.

But frenzy isn&#39;t faithfulness. It&#39;s fear. Fear that if I slow down, I&#39;ll fall behind. Fear that if I rest, I&#39;ll be lazy. Fear that if I&#39;m not producing, I&#39;m not valuable.

The wayfarer moment came when I realized: this isn&#39;t sustainable. I can&#39;t keep living like this. And God doesn&#39;t want me to.

I began to ask different questions:

<ul>
<li>What rhythms bring me life?</li>
<li>What drains me?</li>
<li>What does rest actually look like for me?</li>
<li>What does Jesus&#39; invitation to &quot;easy and light&quot; mean practically?</li>
</ul>

And slowly—so slowly—I started making different choices.

I started saying no to some good things so I could say yes to the most important things.

I started protecting time for rest, not as an afterthought when all the work was done, but as a priority woven into my rhythm.

I started paying attention to my limits and honoring them instead of pretending they didn&#39;t exist.

I started gathering today&#39;s manna and trusting that tomorrow would have its own.

This didn&#39;t happen overnight. It&#39;s still happening. I still slip into frenzy sometimes. I still over-commit. I still try to hoard tomorrow&#39;s grace instead of receiving today&#39;s.

But I&#39;m learning. Learning the unforced rhythms. Learning to walk in step with grace. Learning to work from rest instead of toward it.

And here&#39;s what I&#39;m discovering: sustainable faithfulness is possible. You don&#39;t have to burn out to be faithful. You don&#39;t have to collapse to prove your devotion. You can live in rhythm. You can thrive.

Not because you&#39;ve mastered some technique. But because you&#39;ve accepted the invitation: Come to me. I will give you rest. My yoke is easy. My burden is light.

<h2>Original Writing from the Blog</h2>

Ebb and flow of the waves running over my toes
As I stroll down the shoreline
Sun setting slowly over the horizon
Red flashes of the sky signaling the end of another day
Mind unwinding as I let the stress of the day flee
Into mindful bliss

Your morning breath flows over my face
As I stroll into the pathway through the trees
The morning dew accumulates on the ground
Streaks of light breaking through the clouds of the sunrise
Your words remind me of your ever presence
Into mindful bliss

Starry starry night, full moon shining bright
As I release the burdens of the day
I lift my prayers of praise in your name
Tears dropping down my cheek
Thanking you again for your presence
Into mindful bliss

This is my story, this is my song,
Praising my Savior all the day long;
Angels, descending, bring from above
Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.
Wrapped by rhythms of your grace where I belong
Into mindful bliss

<h2>Song Integration</h2>

<strong>The Season of Frenzy:</strong>

For most of my adult life, I lived at breakneck speed. Always moving. Always producing. Always achieving. My calendar was packed, my to-do list never-ending, my mind constantly racing to the next thing.

I wore busyness like a badge of honor. &quot;I&#39;m swamped&quot; became my default response when people asked how I was doing. And underneath the busyness was a driving anxiety: <em>If I stop moving, I&#39;ll fall behind. If I slow down, I&#39;ll fail. If I rest, I&#39;m weak.</em>

I was exhausted. Burned out. Running on fumes. But I couldn&#39;t see a way out. The frenzy had become my normal.

And then I crashed.

Not dramatically. Just... stopped. My body said &quot;no more.&quot; My mind couldn&#39;t focus. My soul felt hollow. I&#39;d been so busy doing that I&#39;d forgotten how to be.

<strong>The Invitation to Slow:</strong>

In that crashed season, a counselor asked me a simple question: &quot;When was the last time you noticed God&#39;s presence without trying to do anything with it?&quot;

I couldn&#39;t answer. Because I didn&#39;t know how. Every spiritual practice had become performance. Every quiet time had an agenda. I&#39;d turned even rest into productivity.

He gave me one assignment: &quot;Go for a walk. Don&#39;t pray. Don&#39;t problem-solve. Don&#39;t plan. Just notice. Notice what you see, hear, feel. Notice if God shows up.&quot;

I thought it sounded pointless. But I was desperate enough to try.

So I went. Early morning. Walked a trail through trees. And for the first time in years, I just... noticed.

The morning dew on grass. The way light broke through clouds. The sound of birds waking. The gentle breeze on my face.

And something in me exhaled.

This wasn&#39;t productivity. It wasn&#39;t achievement. It was just presence. And in that presence, I encountered God in a way I hadn&#39;t in years.

Not demanding. Not driving. Not urgent.

Just... there. Faithful. Steady. Like He&#39;d been waiting for me to slow down long enough to notice.

<strong>What the Writing Captures:</strong>

The blog writing captures those first moments of learning to notice:

&quot;Sun setting slowly over the horizon... Mind unwinding as I let the stress of the day flee... Into mindful bliss.&quot;

&quot;Your morning breath flows over my face as I stroll into the pathway through the trees... Streaks of light breaking through the clouds... Into mindful bliss.&quot;

&quot;Starry starry night... As I release the burdens of the day... Tears dropping down my cheek, thanking you again for your presence... Into mindful bliss.&quot;

These aren&#39;t dramatic spiritual experiences. They&#39;re ordinary moments made sacred by presence. By choosing to slow down. By paying attention.

The phrase &quot;into mindful bliss&quot; became my shorthand for this way of being. Not forced. Not manufactured. Not achieving anything. Just gently, intentionally present to God&#39;s presence already there.

And that presence—that mindful awareness of grace woven into creation&#39;s rhythms—became the foundation for a sustainable spiritual life.

<strong>What the Song Adds:</strong>

The song &quot;Mindful Bliss of Grace&quot; takes those contemplative moments and weaves them into a declaration of God&#39;s faithfulness.

Where the writing simply notices (&quot;ebb and flow,&quot; &quot;morning dew,&quot; &quot;starry night&quot;), the song proclaims what those moments reveal: &quot;Great is Your faithfulness, steady and true. Mercies each morning are always brand new.&quot;

Where the writing practices presence, the song testifies to what presence uncovers: God&#39;s steadfast love, His holy face, His voice reminding that &quot;love will never fail.&quot;

The progression in the song mirrors the journey from frenzy to rhythm:

<ol>
<li><strong>Noticing</strong> (Verse 1): &quot;Ebb and flow, the waves embrace my feet.&quot; This is learning to slow down, to pay attention to creation&#39;s rhythms.
</li>
<li><strong>Recognizing</strong> (Verse 2): &quot;Morning dew reflects Your tender grace, the sunlight streaks reveal Your holy face.&quot; This is seeing God in the ordinary, realizing He&#39;s been there all along.
</li>
<li><strong>Releasing</strong> (Verse 3): &quot;I lift my heart and cast my cares above.&quot; This is learning to let go, to trust, to rest.
</li>
<li><strong>Testifying</strong> (Verse 4): &quot;This is my story, this is my song, praising my Savior all the day long.&quot; This is the transformation—from frenzy to worship, from striving to resting.
</li>
</ol>

<strong>Why the Song is a Response, Not an Echo:</strong>

The writing is contemplative—quiet observations of God&#39;s presence in nature&#39;s rhythms.

The song is declarative—a proclamation of what those rhythms reveal about God&#39;s character.

Where the writing whispers &quot;I notice You,&quot; the song proclaims &quot;Great is Your faithfulness.&quot;

Where the writing practices presence, the song testifies to faithfulness.

Where the writing captures moments, the song declares the thread connecting all moments: God&#39;s steadfast, never-failing, ever-new mercies.

Together, they answer the question: How do you move from frenzy to sustainable rhythm?

Not by trying harder. Not by adding more spiritual disciplines. But by slowing down long enough to notice that God has been faithful all along. His mercies are new every morning. His love persists through every season.

And when you see that—really see it—frenzy loses its grip.

Because you realize: you don&#39;t have to earn God&#39;s presence through productivity. You don&#39;t have to prove your worth through achievement. You don&#39;t have to run faster to catch up to grace.

Grace is already there. In the ebb and flow. In the morning dew. In the starry night. In the unforced rhythms of creation, reflecting the unforced rhythms of God&#39;s love.

All you have to do is slow down. Notice. Receive.

Into mindful bliss.

<h3>Song: &quot;Mindful Bliss of Grace&quot;</h3>

<strong>[Verse 1]</strong>
Ebb and flow, the waves embrace my feet,
Your whispers call where sea and skylines meet.
The setting sun declares the close of day,
Your steadfast love shines bright along the way.

<strong>[Chorus]</strong>
Great is Your faithfulness, steady and true,
Mercies each morning are always brand new.
Through every season, Your love still persists,
You lead me, Lord, into mindful bliss.

<strong>[Verse 2]</strong>
Morning dew reflects Your tender grace,
The sunlight streaks reveal Your holy face.
Each step I take along the sandy trail,
Your voice reminds me, love will never fail.

<strong>[Chorus]</strong>
Great is Your faithfulness, steady and true,
Mercies each morning are always brand new.
Through every season, Your love still persists,
You lead me, Lord, into mindful bliss.

<strong>[Verse 3]</strong>
Starry skies proclaim Your mighty name,
The moon&#39;s soft glow reveals Your love remains.
I lift my heart and cast my cares above,
Your Spirit wraps me in eternal love.

<strong>[Chorus]</strong>
Great is Your faithfulness, steady and true,
Mercies each morning are always brand new.
Through every season, Your love still persists,
You lead me, Lord, into mindful bliss.

<strong>[Bridge]</strong>
Through trials and storms, through winds that roar,
Your steadfast grace remains forevermore.
Each tear I cry, each prayer I raise,
Lifts me higher to endless praise.

<strong>[Verse 4]</strong>
This is my story, this is my song,
Praising my Savior all the day long.
Mercies descending from heaven above,
Filling my heart with Your endless love.

<strong>[Outro]</strong>
Into mindful bliss, I rest in Your grace,
Each moment I live, I behold Your face.
Your mercies endure, Your promises stay,
Forever I&#39;ll walk in Your holy way.

<h2>Reflections for the Road</h2>

These aren&#39;t homework assignments. They&#39;re invitations to begin living in the unforced rhythms of grace.

<strong>Questions for the Journey:</strong>

<ol>
<li><strong>Where are you living in frenzy instead of rhythm?</strong>

Look at your calendar. Your commitments. Your daily patterns. Where are you reacting instead of choosing? Where are you driven by fear instead of led by grace?

Name it. Be specific. Because you can&#39;t change patterns you won&#39;t acknowledge.
</li>
<li><strong>What does &quot;daily bread&quot; look like for you?</strong>

What are the daily practices that sustain you? Prayer? Scripture reading? Silence? Journaling? Walking?

Are you trying to live off yesterday&#39;s manna? Are you hoarding for tomorrow? Or are you gathering today&#39;s bread and trusting tomorrow will have its own?
</li>
<li><strong>What do you want to see MORE of in your life? What LESS of? What NOT AT ALL?</strong>

These aren&#39;t rhetorical questions. Write down your answers. Be honest. Be specific.

From these answers, what one thing could you change this week to move from frenzy toward rhythm?
</li>
<li><strong>Read Matthew 11:28-30 slowly. What does Jesus&#39; invitation to &quot;easy and light&quot; mean for you today?</strong>

Where are you carrying a yoke that&#39;s too heavy? Where are you working against grace instead of with it? What would it look like to trade that heavy yoke for Jesus&#39; easy one?
</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>Practice: Creating Your Rule of Life</h2>

Many Christians throughout history have created what they called a &quot;Rule of Life&quot;—not rules in the legalistic sense, but rhythms. Patterns. A framework for sustainable spiritual living.

Here&#39;s a simple process to begin creating yours:

<strong>1. Listen to your life</strong>

What brings you life? What drains you? When do you feel most connected to God? When do you feel most disconnected?

Don&#39;t rush this. Pay attention for a few days. Notice patterns.

<strong>2. Identify life-giving rhythms</strong>

Based on what you&#39;ve noticed, what rhythms sustain you?

Maybe it&#39;s:

<ul>
<li>Morning prayer before the day starts</li>
<li>A weekly Sabbath</li>
<li>Daily walks</li>
<li>Monthly solitude retreats</li>
<li>Regular connection with a spiritual friend</li>
</ul>

Write them down.

<strong>3. Build them into your life as rhythm, not rules</strong>

The difference between rhythm and rules is this: rules say &quot;you have to.&quot; Rhythms say &quot;this is life-giving.&quot;

Don&#39;t try to implement everything at once. Pick one or two rhythms and build them into your life this month. Let them become patterns. Then add another.

<strong>4. Hold them loosely</strong>

Life changes. Seasons change. What worked last year might not work this year. That&#39;s okay.

The goal isn&#39;t perfection. It&#39;s sustainability. It&#39;s learning to walk in step with grace, not trying to earn grace through perfect performance.

<strong>5. Review and adjust</strong>

Every few months, review your rhythms. What&#39;s working? What&#39;s not? What needs to change?

This isn&#39;t failure—it&#39;s wisdom. You&#39;re learning to pay attention to how God has made you and what you need to thrive.

Dallas Willard writes: &quot;Grace is not opposed to effort, it is opposed to earning.&quot;

Your Rule of Life isn&#39;t about earning God&#39;s approval. It&#39;s about creating space where transformation can happen. Where you can receive grace in rhythm. Where you can live in the easy yoke and light burden Jesus offers.

<hr>

<h2>Closing Image</h2>

You&#39;re not at the water&#39;s edge anymore. You&#39;ve waded in deeper. And you&#39;ve discovered something surprising: the water has a current.

Not a violent current that sweeps you away. A gentle current. A flow. And when you stop fighting it—when you stop trying to control every movement—you realize the current is carrying you.

This is what the unforced rhythms feel like. You&#39;re not striving anymore. Not forcing. Not manufacturing spiritual experiences or trying to prove your worth through exhausting effort.

You&#39;re flowing. With grace. In rhythm.

Some days the water is calm. You float. You rest. You simply be.

Some days the water is active. You swim. You work. You engage. But even the swimming feels different now. You&#39;re not swimming against the current, desperately trying to get somewhere. You&#39;re swimming with it, letting it carry you along.

You look up and see the sun filtering through the water. Streaks of light. Steady. Reliable. New every morning.

Great is His faithfulness.

You take a breath—deep, full, unforced. And you realize: this is sustainable. This is how you were meant to live. Not in crisis mode. Not in frenzy. But in rhythm. In flow. In the unforced rhythms of grace.

You can hear the invitation echoing in the water:

<em>Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.</em>

And you whisper back, not with words but with the posture of your whole being:

<em>Yes. I&#39;m coming. I&#39;m learning. I&#39;m resting in Your easy yoke and light burden.</em>

The current carries you forward. Gently. Steadily. In rhythm.

And you are, for perhaps the first time in your life, truly at peace.

Into mindful bliss.

<h3>MOVEMENT 3: UNFORCED RHYTHMS (The Transformation)</h3>

<blockquote>
<strong>📢 &quot;Dying Changes Everything: A Wayfarer&#39;s Journey&quot; is being replaced by <a href="https://www.skylerthomas.com/out-of-the-swamp-a-wayfarers-journey-introduction/">Out of the Swamp: How I found TRUTH</a></strong>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
&quot;Are you tired? Worn out? Burned out on religion? Come to me. Get away with me and you&#39;ll recover your life. I&#39;ll show you how to take a real rest. Walk with me and work with me—watch how I do it. Learn the unforced rhythms of grace. I won&#39;t lay anything heavy or ill-fitting on you. Keep company with me and you&#39;ll learn to live freely and lightly.&quot;

— Matthew 11:28-30 (MSG)
</blockquote>

A breath. A shift. The water&#39;s edge is behind now.

You&#39;re clean—or at least, being cleaned. The process continues, but something fundamental has changed. You&#39;re no longer drowning in the swamp. You&#39;re no longer desperately gasping at the water&#39;s edge.

You&#39;re learning to swim. Better yet—you&#39;re learning to float.

This is the place of transformation. Not the dramatic moment of crisis or the pivotal encounter at the shoreline, but the steady, daily rhythm of learning to live in grace. The unforced rhythms.

For so long, life felt like striving. Performing. Pushing. Proving. Even spirituality became another arena for achievement—pray more, serve more, be more. The Christian life looked like a treadmill set at an impossible pace, and you were exhausted trying to keep up.

But Jesus offers something radically different. Not a faster pace or a better technique. Not more rules or higher standards. He offers <em>unforced rhythms</em>. A way of living that flows from grace, not toward it. A life sustained by love, not driven by fear.

This movement explores what it means to live in those rhythms. To plant deep roots that draw from living water. To recognize that God is writing a redemption story—and nothing in your story is wasted. To walk in the authority that comes from knowing the enemy is defeated. To embrace each moment as sacred, as an invitation to meet God in the present.

The chapters ahead aren&#39;t about arriving. They&#39;re about abiding. About learning to rest in motion, to work from rest, to live from the overflow of grace rather than the depletion of performance.

You&#39;ve made it through the swamp. You&#39;ve stepped into the water. Now you&#39;re discovering what it means to let grace carry you—to live in the unforced rhythms God designed you for all along.

<hr>

<strong>The Journey in Unforced Rhythms:</strong>

<strong>Chapter 9: Unforced Rhythms of Grace</strong> - From striving to surrender, from performance to presence. Discover the sustainable pace of grace—not frantic religious activity, but the steady rhythms of a life rooted in God&#39;s love. Learn what it means to work from rest, not toward it.
[audio src="https://www.skylerthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Mindful-Bliss-Male.mp3"]
<strong>Chapter 10: Deep Roots, Strong Growth</strong> - Like a tree planted by streams of water, transformation happens underground before it&#39;s visible above the surface. Explore the hidden work of spiritual formation—putting to death what doesn&#39;t belong and cultivating what does. Deep roots produce lasting fruit.
[audio src="https://www.skylerthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/I-Will-Trust-You-Lord.mp3"]
<strong>Chapter 11: Redemption&#39;s Story</strong> - Your story is part of God&#39;s story—from creation to consummation, from fall to redemption. See how every chapter of your life, even the broken ones, fits into the grand narrative of grace. The gospel isn&#39;t just a story you believe; it&#39;s the story you&#39;re living.
[audio src="https://www.skylerthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Redemption-Story.mp3"]
<strong>Chapter 12: Nothing is Wasted</strong> - In the economy of God, nothing is wasted—not the waiting, not the weeping, not the wondering. Every tear, every trial, every surrender is redeemed and repurposed. Like Abraham on Mount Moriah, we learn that even our most painful offerings become the ground where God provides.
[audio src="https://www.skylerthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Nothing-is-Wasted-Remastered.mp3"]
<strong>Chapter 13: Devil&#39;s On The Run</strong> - The enemy is defeated—not by your effort, but by Christ&#39;s victory. Learn to fight from rest, to resist from a place of authority, to recognize that spiritual warfare isn&#39;t about gaining ground but standing firm on ground already won. The devil is a liar, and he&#39;s on the run.
[audio src="https://www.skylerthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Devils-On-The-Run-III-Remix-Remastered-Remix.mp3"]
<strong>Chapter 14: Living in the Moment</strong> - Made in the image of God, every moment of your life carries divine weight and purpose. Not yesterday&#39;s regrets or tomorrow&#39;s anxieties, but this breath, this step, this holy now. God is not just the God of your past or your future—He is the God of today, inviting you to live fully present in His grace.
[audio src="https://www.skylerthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/This-Moment-is-Enough.mp3"]

<h2>The Invitation</h2>

The swamp taught you honesty. The water&#39;s edge taught you surrender. Now the unforced rhythms teach you how to live—how to abide, how to rest, how to let grace carry you through every season.

This isn&#39;t about perfection. It&#39;s about presence. It&#39;s about learning to walk with God not in the dramatic moments but in the daily ones. Not in the crisis but in the ordinary. Not in the striving but in the surrender.

The journey continues. But now you&#39;re not alone in the struggle. You&#39;re carried by grace, rooted in love, living in the rhythm God designed for you from the beginning.

Welcome to the unforced rhythms of grace.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Skyler Thomas</strong>&nbsp;is a songwriter, writer, and wayfarer who believes that honest stories and grace-filled truth have the power to change lives.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Born and raised in across many states of the U.S. of A., Skyler has spent a lifetime exploring the intersection of faith, music, and spiritual formation. Through personal struggles and profound encounters with God's grace, Skyler discovered that transformation doesn't happen through striving, but through surrender to the unforced rhythms of grace.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This book represents over a dozen years of journaling, songwriting, and wrestling with what it means to follow Jesus in the midst of real life—messy, broken, beautiful, and redeemed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Skyler's music and writing can be found at&nbsp;<strong>skylerthomas.com</strong>, where you can access all the songs featured in this book, read additional blog posts, and connect with a growing community of wayfarers learning to walk in grace.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When not writing or making music, Skyler enjoys family and friends building memories.</p>

<p><em>"These songs and stories aren't just mine—they're ours. I'm simply putting words to what so many of us have experienced but struggle to name. My prayer is that somewhere in these pages, you find your own story reflected back to you, and you hear God whisper: 'I see you. I know you. And I'm not done with you yet.'"</em></p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Epilogue: The Road Ahead</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://github.com/esarks/SkylerThomas2/wiki/99_epilogue#epilogue-the-road-ahead"></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You've journeyed from swamp to water's edge to unforced rhythms. You've named your struggle, cried out in prayer, made the decision to stop and choose life, and discovered that dying to self changes everything.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You've been washed at the water's edge, learning what it means to live in the shadow of grace, receiving what you could never earn, and digging deeper into healing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And you've begun to walk in the unforced rhythms of grace—sending roots deep, discovering redemption's story woven through your life, learning that nothing is wasted, standing firm because the devil is on the run, and living fully present in this moment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But here's the truth I need you to hear before you close this book:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>This isn't the end. It's the beginning.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Christian life isn't about arriving at some final destination where everything is fixed and all questions are answered. It's about walking with Jesus—day by day, moment by moment, breath by breath.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There will be days when you feel like you're back in the swamp. When old patterns resurface. When shame whispers that you haven't really changed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On those days, remember: you're not starting over. You're continuing forward. The work God began in you, He is faithful to complete (Philippians 1:6).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There will be days when grace feels distant. When you're exhausted from trying to live up to standards you were never meant to carry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On those days, come back to the water's edge. Let grace wash over you again. It's not a one-time event—it's a daily returning to the truth of who you are in Christ.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There will be days when the rhythms feel forced. When life speeds up and you lose your footing in the chaos.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On those days, hear Jesus' invitation again: "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest" (Matthew 11:28). The rhythms are always unforced. The striving is always unnecessary. He is always enough.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Now?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://github.com/esarks/SkylerThomas2/wiki/99_epilogue#what-now"></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you're wondering what to do next, here are a few suggestions:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>1. Go back through the "Reflections for the Road" questions.</strong>&nbsp;Don't rush. Sit with each one. Journal. Pray. Be honest with God and with yourself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2. Practice one thing from this book consistently.</strong>&nbsp;Maybe it's the Daily Examen from Chapter 14. Maybe it's breath prayers throughout your day. Maybe it's naming your swamp and bringing it to God in honest prayer. Pick one. Do it. Let it become a rhythm.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>3. Find a community.</strong>&nbsp;This journey isn't meant to be walked alone. Find people who will listen without judgment, who will speak truth in love, who will remind you of grace when you forget.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>4. Listen to the songs.</strong>&nbsp;Music has a way of reaching places words alone can't touch. Let these songs become part of your prayer life, your worship, your remembering.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>5. Keep walking.</strong>&nbsp;Some days you'll sprint. Some days you'll crawl. Some days you'll sit still and rest. All of it is part of the journey. Just don't stop moving toward Jesus.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A Final Word</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://github.com/esarks/SkylerThomas2/wiki/99_epilogue#a-final-word"></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I don't know where you are right now. Maybe you're in the deepest part of the swamp, and this book felt like a lifeline. Maybe you're at the water's edge, tentatively stepping into grace. Maybe you're learning the rhythms and discovering that life with Jesus is better than you imagined.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wherever you are, know this:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>God isn't finished with you. Grace is still sufficient. This moment is still enough.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the One who called you out of the swamp is faithful to walk with you every step of the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keep walking, wayfarer. The journey is just beginning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
