Devotional: A Reflection of the Creator

Have you ever looked in the mirror and wondered if you were enough? If you were worthy? If you had purpose? The world is quick to measure our value by external factors—accomplishments, social status, appearance, or the approval of others. But God has already spoken the greatest truth about who you are: 
You are made in His image.

Being made in God’s image doesn’t mean we are all-powerful, all-knowing, or perfect. It means we carry something of Him within us—His creativity, His love, His capacity for relationship, and His longing for what is right and good. It means we are set apart, created with purpose, and designed for connection—with God and with each other.

Yet, we struggle. We struggle with our imperfections, our weaknesses, our past mistakes. Sometimes we allow these struggles to define us, forgetting the divine imprint on our souls. But 
God’s image in you is not erased by your failures, nor is His love for you diminished by your doubts.
 His truth stands firm: 
You belong to Him.

So rather than seeking approval from the world, seek the One who formed you with love. Rather than defining yourself by what you are not, embrace what He says you are: 
precious, chosen, and created for His glory.
 In that truth, we find our purpose—not to strive endlessly for worldly validation, but to live as reflections of His love and grace.

Prayer:

Heavenly Father,
Thank You for creating me in Your image. When I feel lost, remind me of who I am in You. When I struggle with doubts, let Your truth be my foundation. Help me to embrace the identity You have given me—not based on my achievements or failures, but on Your unchanging love. May I live each day as a reflection of Your grace, seeking to honor You in all I do. I surrender my fears and insecurities to You, and I choose to trust in Your perfect plan for my life.

In Jesus' Name, Amen.

Writing:

You may struggle, like me, to know God
Sometimes I feel I have been misled by people claiming to know God
And them trying to convince me that I do not know God in the right way
And that I must follow their version of Truth, whatever that may be

While even I applaud their passion, I feel at times it is misguided in selfish ambition
As if they get points if I sign up to be on their team; join "their" church

But, I want to know God on my terms…or rather, on His terms for me

I cannot deny His existence; I will not
Neither do I choose a mediocre ambivalence
Maybe I want something more meaningful than a passive aggression

Let's just say I DO want to know God; to seek Him; truly seek Him
Where shall I start?

To be made in the image of God?
What does that mean?

Does it mean I am like Him…
…In His wisdom?
...In His knowledge?
...In His power?
...In His supremacy?

Exactly how am I made in the image of God?
I think HE even said I am made in HIS image
HE said that…the one who claims to have made ME

Clearly though…
…I am not almighty
...I am not omniscient
...I am not omnipotent
...I am not invincible
...I am not the creator of all things

I'm not even like Captain Marvel or any of the Super Heroes; Let alone God

I'm just little ole me
But I am ME
And HE said I am made in HIS image

Truth is…
...I act out imperfection
...I act out weakness
…I act out failure
…I even act out not wanting to be loved or accepted

But…
…I am not failure
…I am not imperfection
…I am not weakness

…I am worthy of love
…I am worthy of acceptance
…I am worthy to attain beyond what my flesh can

Because… HE said so…and HE said I am made in HIS image

I can deny it…
I can ignore it…
I can turn and run away from it…
I can close my eyes…
I can cover my ears…
I can pretend not to see or hear it

Or…
I can recognize it…for what it is
I can acknowledge it....for what it is
I can embrace it…for what it is

Embrace what, you ask?

That I am made for emotion…
That I am made for love…
That I am made for acceptance…
That I am made for being valued…
That I am made for compassion…
That I am made for connection…to be more than just me…
That I am made for Worship of the One who made me in HIS image…just as I am

That’s how I’m wired…
That’s how I’m created…
In the image of God

Therefore because I am made in HIS image, I bow down…and worship YOU, oh God

Song:

Verse 1:

You formed the stars, You shaped the sea

Yet still Your breath brings life to me

Not by my strength, nor by my might

But by Your love, I walk in light

Chorus:

I am made in Your image, oh Lord

I am loved, I am known, I am Yours

Every breath that I take, every step that I make

Let me echo Your grace now and more

Verse 2:

When I feel lost and doubts arise

Still You are near to hear my cries

You call me child, You call me friend

Your love remains, it has no end

Bridge:

No fear can shake me, no lie can break me

Your truth is written deep inside

No chains can bind me, Your love reminds me

You’ve walked beside me all my life

Chorus (repeat):

I am made in Your image, oh Lord

I am loved, I am known, I am Yours

Every breath that I take, every step that I make

Let me echo Your grace now and more

Outro (same melody as chorus, soft and reflective):

I am made in Your image, oh Lord

I am held, I am safe, I am Yours

Every breath that I take, every step that I make

I will sing of Your love evermore
