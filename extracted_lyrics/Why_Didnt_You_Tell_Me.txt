Song: Why Didn't You Tell Me About Jesus
============================================================

Song:

Verse 1
We were neighbors all those years
Shared the laughter, shared the tears
You had peace I never knew
But you never said what carried you

Verse 2
We would greet the New Year’s light
Holidays felt warm and bright
You stood by me when grief was near
With something deeper holding fear

Chorus
Why didn’t you tell me about Jesus?
Why didn’t you speak of His name?
You offered your kindness, your time, and your care
But never the heart of your flame
You smiled when the storm didn’t cease
You walked with a holy peace
Why didn’t you tell me about Jesus?

Verse 3
Maybe our love was growing slow
Rooted deep where words don’t go
We would talk of dreams and age
But never turned the final page

Verse 4
Every Sunday you would leave
With a calm I can’t conceive
I watched you go, but never knew
The One who quietly shaped you

Chorus
Why didn’t you tell me about Jesus?
Why didn’t you speak of His name?
You offered your kindness, your time, and your care
But never the heart of your flame
You smiled when the storm didn’t cease
You walked with a holy peace
Why didn’t you tell me about Jesus?

Bridge
Were you waiting for the day
When I’d ask or find my way?
Did you think I wouldn’t see
The light you carried silently?

Final Chorus
Now I walk through years behind
With your memory on my mind
If only you’d told me what gave you your song—
The place where your soul did belong
That love you could never release
The source of your quiet peace
Why didn’t you tell me about Jesus?

Outro (soft and prayerful)
I might have asked Him to show me the way
But I wish you'd told me that day…
About Jesus
