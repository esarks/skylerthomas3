Male Vocal

Female Vocal

Galatians 5:22-23 New International Version
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law.

A Prayer:

Lord, our eyes are on you

To accept the love of your grace

Fully embracing joy and its healing power

Seeking your peace amidst today’s chaos

Showing others patience even when we are wronged

Treating others with the kindness we wish to receive

Being an example of goodness in the face of evil

Living out integrity as you exemplify integrity in your faithfulness to us

Granting others gentleness instead of judgment

Walking hand-in-hand with the Spirit of self-control

Lord, our eyes are on you

Song Lyrics:

(Verse 1)

In the quiet of the morning, Lord, we seek Your face,
Through the shadows and the stillness, we receive Your grace.
Guide our hearts with patience, let Your mercy flow,
In the beauty of Your presence, may our spirits grow.

(Chorus)

Oh Lord, You are our refuge, shelter from the storm,
In Your arms of mercy, keep us safe and warm.
With Your Spirit guiding, we will trust and sing,
In Your love unending, we find everything.

(Verse 2)

Teach us kindness, teach us the grace, show us how to be,
A reflection of Your goodness for the world to see.
When the path is heavy, and road is long,
Let Your truth sustain us, and Your joy be our song.

(Chorus)

Oh Lord, You are our refuge, shelter from the storm,
In Your arms of mercy, keep us safe and warm.
With Your Spirit guiding, we will trust and sing,
In Your love unending, we find everything.

(Bridge)

Grant us hearts of gentleness, hands that freely give,
May our lives be offerings, in the way we live.
Through the trials and the triumphs, faithful we will stay,
Walking in Your footsteps, on the narrow way.

(Chorus)

Oh Lord, You are our refuge, shelter from the storm,
In Your arms of mercy, keep us safe and warm.
With Your Spirit guiding, we will trust and sing,
In Your love unending, we find everything.

(Outro)

Lord, our hope is in You, every step we take,
Hold us in Your mercy, for Your glory’s sake.
