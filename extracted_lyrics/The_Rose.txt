Dedicated to the love my life, my bride.

From the fertile soil
In the Master’s care
Your leaves spring forth
A Rose to bare

This gift of beauty
For all the world to see
Your tenderness, your fragrance
Is meant to be

The symbol of your love
A witness to us all
Of His gift to those
Who will hear His call

For we're not persuaded
By force or might
But we are drawn
To the Rose’s light

It is your compassion
Your gentleness, your care
That brings rest to the weary
While their burden you share

And in the gentle whisper
That your love does impart
Those near you are drawn
To the Savior’s heart

In the Master's great plan
There's none like the Rose
For it is through your beauty
His love He shows

And when this life is over
When you've shed your last tear
God has a special place
Forever and ever for you to be near
