Song: You Still Know My Name

Devotional: "You Still Know My Name"

Key Scriptures: Revelation 2:17 &amp; Psalm 139

Have you ever felt invisible in a crowded room? Like no one sees you—not really? In a world where billions have lived and died, it’s easy to wonder: 
Do I even matter?
 And yet, this song reminds us of a soul-anchoring truth: 
God knows your name.

Revelation 2:17 contains a mysterious promise:

“To the one who is victorious, I will give... a white stone with a new name written on it, known only to the one who receives it.”

This verse doesn’t just speak of intimacy—it screams it. The God who reigns over galaxies also hands you a stone—a personal gift—engraved with a name known only between you and Him. That’s relationship.

Psalm 139 echoes the same divine intimacy. God knit you together in the secret place. Before you spoke a word, He knew every phrase. He’s the Author of your days and the Listener of your nights. You are never out of His reach or hidden from His sight. Whether you’re drowning in shame, plagued by doubt, or grieving in silence, 
He still knows your name.

This song reflects the sacred promise that God’s knowledge of you isn’t just factual—it’s relational.
He doesn’t just know 
about
 you.
He knows 
you
.

In your darkest night, He whispers peace. When voices of shame rise, He breaks through with love. And when you think you've wandered too far, He chooses to stay. Not because you're flawless—but because you're 
fully known and fully claimed
.

That name He calls you? It isn’t 
mistake
 or 
failure
.
It’s 
beloved
, 
redeemed
, 
His
.
And He’s never forgotten it.

Prayer:

God,
Thank You for knowing me so deeply and loving me so faithfully.
When the noise of life overwhelms me, remind me that You are still near—still speaking peace over my soul.
Even when I feel lost or ashamed, You never turn away.
You call me by name.
You guide me through the fire, through the doubt, through the fear.
I rest in the promise that You see me, You’ve claimed me, and You’ll never let me go.
Today, I choose to believe You still know my name.
Amen.

Song Lyrics:

Verse 1
Billions have walked this world before,
But still—You see me,
You search my heart, then love me more.
Before I speak, You know each phrase.
You go before me all my days—
You still know my name.

Pre-Chorus
Even in the dark, You find me there,
When I try to hide, You’re well aware.
From the highest heaven to the deepest grave,
You won’t let go… You won’t turn away.

Chorus
In the darkest night, when the voices rise,
And the weight of the world is loud in my mind—
You whisper peace, You break the shame,
You still know my name.
When life turns cruel, and I feel alone,
Like You’ve turned Your face and left me on my own—
Still, You remain, forever the same—
And You still know my name.

Verse 2
You knit me in the secret place,
Each thread was touched with holy grace.
You wrote the days You’d planned for me—
More than the sands beside the sea.
When I feel lost or small and ashamed,
You still know my name.

Pre-Chorus
Even in the dark, You find me there,
When I try to hide, You’re well aware.
From the highest heaven to the deepest grave,
You won’t let go… You won’t turn away.

Chorus
In the darkest night, when the voices rise,
And the weight of the world is loud in my mind—
You whisper peace, You break the shame,
You still know my name.
When life turns cruel, and I feel alone,
Like You’ve turned Your face and left me on my own—
Still, You remain, forever the same—
And You still know my name.

Verse 3
Some days I drown in doubt and fear,
With questions only You can hear.
But through the fire, You never leave,
You stand beside me when I grieve.
No shame or guilt can stake a claim—
You still know my name.

Bridge
Where can I go from Your Spirit? Nowhere.
If I ride the dawn, You’re already there.
If I lie down in the depths of pain,
Even there—You call my name.
Your hand will guide me,
Your love will find me.

Final Chorus
In the mystery, in the fear,
When I wonder if You’re near—
I hear You call me by my name…
You still know my name.
No matter how far I’ve run or strayed,
You saw it all—yet You chose to stay.
I’m fully known, fully claimed—
And You still know my name.

Outro
You still know…
You still know…
You still know my name.
