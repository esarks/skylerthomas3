"But, as it is written, What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man imagined, what God has prepared for those who love Him."

Devotional: The Great Divide - A Promise of Eternity

In our quest for understanding, we often find ourselves contemplating what lies beyond the veil of this life.

“What’s it like, this great divide,
That sweeps us from this life away,”

We often refer to crossing “a great divide” when we speak of passing from this life to the next. This “great divide” symbolizes the transition from our earthly existence to the eternal presence of God, a passage that is filled with anticipation and hope. As believers, we are assured that what awaits us is something so magnificent that it surpasses any earthly experience. This transition is not just a final goodbye; it is a threshold of grace where our souls will truly abide, free from the burdens and woes that weigh us down in this life.

"Is it akin to passing through a veil,
Where whispers float on gentle air,"

The imagery of passing through a veil captures the idea of entering into God's presence. Here, we are invited to imagine ourselves enveloped in a gentle embrace of whispers wafting through the air, where the symphonies of heaven reveal a world far beyond our current understanding. The question arises—what shall we first behold?

“Will we behold those pearly gates,
That glimmer soft with stories told?”

Perhaps it will be these gates that usher us into the presence of God, or maybe it will be vast fields filled with color, a radiant tapestry displaying the beauty of creation in all its forms, much richer than the mere streets of gold often described.

As we envision our heavenly home, we picture ourselves greeted by a chorus of souls—a heavenly choir filled with joy and love. Each welcoming heart helps us comprehend that this is a place of eternal communion, where laughter and warmth lift us higher, showcasing the depth of God’s grace and love.

In contemplating what heaven may be like, we consider the vibrant colors and profound sounds that await us. Each note, each sound, a remarkable testament to the joy of salvation; a chorus that makes us whole and fills our spirits with elation.

Indeed, Heaven is a fitting symbol of life in its most beautiful form.

“Imagine gardens where flowers bloom,
With fragrances that wrap around,”

These visual and sensory experiences invite us to wonder about the depths of God’s creation, a constant reminder of hope in our current journey.

As we move through life, we often yearn for peace and comfort. We are to be reminded of the intimacy of love found even in the smallest moments—a reflection of God's love, which invites us to embrace vulnerability and connection.

Ultimately, our hearts are drawn to the promise of an eternal life filled with grace. We look forward to the day when shadows will dissolve and fears will be no more.

“Gone are the shadows, fears dissolved,
Where pain and want are fully healed.”

What lies ahead is incomprehensible by human understanding, yet it is filled with promise, embraced in divine love.

Prayer

Dear Heavenly Father, we thank You for the hope of eternity. Help us to keep our hearts focused on the promise of what lies ahead. As we journey through life, may we find comfort in the imagery of Your love and grace, eagerly anticipating the day when we step into Your glorious presence. Teach us to live in the light of that promise, trusting in Your plan for our lives. Amen.

Closing Thought

As we reflect on the beauty of heaven and the great divide that leads us there, let us walk through each day with anticipation, filled with hope and love. Heaven awaits us—a vibrant tapestry of colors, sounds, and embrace, reminding us to cherish each moment as a reflection of the eternal joy that is to come. Hold tight to the promise that one day we’ll find our place in the glorious embrace of our Creator.

A Writing

What’s it like, this great divide,
That sweeps us from this life away,
A threshold graced where souls abide,
Where earthly woes no longer weigh?

Is it akin to passing through a veil,
Where whispers float on gentle air,
And symphonies of grand detail,
Reveal a world beyond compare?

Will we behold those pearly gates,
That glimmer soft with stories told,
Or shall we glimpse vast, open estates,
A tapestry of colors bold?

Will a chorus of souls greet me there,
Thronging to welcome, a heavenly choir,
With open arms and joy to share,
Their laughter and love lifting me higher.

We’ve heard of streets where gold is laid,
Yet gold seems narrow, a single hue,
Could heaven be a vibrant cascade,
A master’s palette where visions are new?

Imagine reds like canyon floors,
Where sunlight spills, embracing earth,
Each hue's a song that gently soars,
A celebration of life and birth.

What sounds shall greet us, sweet and clear,
With symphonies that touch the soul?
A chorus of joy, so pure, sincere,
Each note a story, making us whole.

Will greens emerge like forests deep,
With creatures dancing, wild and free,
And floral scents that softly creep,
Each blossom unveiling the mystery?

Imagine gardens where flowers bloom,
With fragrances that wrap around,
In every petal, our hearts consume,
As nature whispers, hope profound.

Surely there’ll be oceans, blue and deep,
That invite our hearts to sail free,
With gentle waves that stir and sweep,
A celebration of love’s decree.

Rather than mansions dimly lit,
With countless rooms and silent halls,
I long to soar where spirits flit,
Beyond the bounds where starlight calls.

Oh, the softness of a baby’s skin,
A tender touch that warms the heart,
In every hug, a world begins,
A simple love that plays its part.

A symphony of colors blend,
Like Kodachrome, each moment sing,
Forever praising without end,
In joyful reverence to our King.

An eternity to spread His grace,
To honor Him, the guiding light,
For in His arms, we find our place,
No longer lost, but pure delight.

Gone are the shadows, fears dissolved,
Where pain and want are fully healed,
Tears wiped away, love’s truth resolved,
As life forever is finally sealed.

Yet still I ponder what awaits,
In realms unseen, where dreams ignite,
A dimension where the heart elates,
My spirit dances in endless light.

More than my mind can grasp or know,
Beyond the visions I can weave,
Heaven’s embrace will freely flow,
In perfect love, we shall believe.

So I await, with hope in sway,
The moment when I shall step through,
To find the colors, bright as day,
A life renewed, forever true.

What No Eye Has Seen

(Inspired by 1 Corinthians 2:9)

Verse 1

No eye has seen, no ear has known,
The plans You’ve made, the love You’ve shown.
Beyond the veil, where hope takes flight,
Your glory shines, eternal light.

Pre-Chorus

What heart can dream, what words can say,
The beauty of that coming day?

Chorus

Oh, heaven sings, its voice so sweet,
A song of joy, our souls to greet.
Where tears are gone and shadows cease,
We’ll rest forever in Your peace.
What no eye has seen, no heart can hold,
Unveiled in love, Your plan unfolds.

Verse 2

The skies will gleam, the stars will bow,
Creation sings its anthem now.
Yet more than this, Your face we’ll see,
The boundless love that sets us free.

Pre-Chorus

What heart can dream, what words can say,
The beauty of that coming day?

Chorus

Oh, heaven sings, its voice so sweet,
A song of joy, our souls to greet.
Where tears are gone and shadows cease,
We’ll rest forever in Your peace.
What no eye has seen, no heart can hold,
Unveiled in love, Your plan unfolds.

Bridge

Imagine fields of endless grace,
Where every soul beholds Your face.
Each step a dance, each breath a song,
With saints and angels all along.

Chorus

Oh, heaven sings, its voice so sweet,
A song of joy, our souls to greet.
Where tears are gone and shadows cease,
We’ll rest forever in Your peace.
What no eye has seen, no heart can hold,
Unveiled in love, Your plan unfolds.

Final Chorus

When I cross that great divide,
And stand before You, arms spread wide.
What no eye has seen, my soul will find,
In You, my Lord, for all of time.
