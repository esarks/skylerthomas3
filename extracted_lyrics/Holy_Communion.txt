Song: Holy Communion
============================================================

Devotional

1 Corinthians 10:16-17 (NIV)

“Is not the cup of thanksgiving for which we give thanks a participation in the blood of Christ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ? Because there is one loaf, we, who are many, are one body, for we all share the one loaf.”

It's a weekly thing we do.  Sometimes it may seem too much like "checking off a box" on Sunday.

But as we gather around the Lord’s Table, we don’t come to perform a ritual. We come to meet a Savior.

We want to experience this moment as sacred—not out of tradition alone, but because Jesus Himself meets us here. He is the Host and the Offering. The Bread and the Cup are not mere symbols—they are 
signs of grace
, 
channels of mercy
, and 
echoes of a love poured out
.

We remember how, in the upper room, Jesus broke bread with trembling hands, knowing the cross awaited. He gave thanks. He shared the cup. And He told His disciples,&nbsp;
“Do this in remembrance of Me.”

Not because He needed to be remembered—but because&nbsp;
we
&nbsp;needed to remember:
His suffering.
His love.
His victory.
And the unity He purchased with His blood.

As the lyrics say:

“This table is no empty rite,
No hollow invitation.”

We are invited not as perfect people, but as&nbsp;
those made pure by His grace
.
We come&nbsp;
with hearts contrite
, seeking not just to take bread and wine, but to be changed.
This is a place of&nbsp;
healing
—where Christ binds up wounds, restores weary souls, and renews our hope.

Prayer:

Lord Jesus,
We come to Your table with awe and humility.
Thank You for inviting us, cleansing us, and calling us Your own.
In this bread and cup, let us not forget the cost of our salvation.
Let all pretense be ended. Let all striving cease.
Renew our minds. Heal our hearts. Bind us together in Your love.

We remember You.
We worship You.
We belong to You.

In Your holy name,
Amen

Holy Communion Song Lyrics

Verse 1
This is a holy, sacred time,
We gather at the table.
To take the bread, to drink the wine,
As Jesus did, so faithful.
He prayed with love, His heart laid bare,
He broke the bread with sorrow.
And now in quiet, humbled prayer,
In His grace we follow.

Verse 2
We do this week by passing week,
And year by year we gather.
Not just by habit, cold or weak,
But seeking Christ our Savior.
For here we taste the love He gives,
Our hearts restored, forgiven.
In this, our weary spirit lives—
Renewed by touch of heaven.

Chorus
Come, remember
Come, renew
Let His mercy flow through you
Come, be one
In sacred sign
In His body—bread and wine
In His body—bread and wine

Verse 3
This table is no empty rite,
No hollow invitation
We come with hearts contrite,
In deep and true reflection.
Prepare our hearts, renew our minds,
Let all pretense be ended
For in this bread, the Savior binds
The wounds His love has mended. 

Verse 4
So let us come in unity,
As those made pure and holy.
His body shared in mystery,
His love poured out so lowly.
The bread, His flesh; the cup, His blood—
A grace beyond all measure.
This sacred meal, this cleansing flood,
Our refuge and our treasure.

Chorus
Come, remember
Come, renew
Let His mercy flow through you
Come, be one
In sacred sign
In His body—bread and wine
In His body—bread and wine

Bridge
Jesus, Lamb of God,
Who takes away our sin,
Let this bread and cup
Draw us close again.
We remember You,
We remember love—
Broken for us
From heaven above.

Outro
So take and eat, and drink the wine,
And meet with Christ once more.
He meets us here with nail-scarred hands
And opens mercy’s door.
