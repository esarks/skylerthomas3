Composition and production of song by Kenn Mann.

Song Lyrics

The proud warrior stood in the face of his enemy
To battle with all of his might

The crowd gathered round
They were filled with intensity
To see who would win in the fight

Now most folks would cheer for the proud warrior's legacy
Hoping for bloodshed and death

The time was approaching
The battle was almost here

When from the shadows the lamb now appeared
Offering a rose to the warrior that day
In total humility and love

But the proud warrior offered no more than a sword
As the battle had finally begun

The news spread like wildfire
The warrior was victorious and strong

But history would prove that his victory wasn't victory at all
And pride goes before a fall
The lamb died that day for us all

The masses continued to follow the warrior
So proud of the wars he had won

But for those who believed in the humble contender
They bowed the knee for what he had done

They sang "Jesus Rose of Sharon bloom here within my heart
Bloom here with radiance, humility and love
Bloom here within my heart
Just as I Am, oh Lamb of God"
(Repeat)

Lamb of God...

Original Writing

The proud warrior stood in the face of his enemy to fight
Giving it his all with every strength, every weapon and all his might

The crowd gathered around as the intensity did grow
Waiting to see what weapons they would choose; who would deliver the final blow

Most cheered for the proud warrior, much fewer for the contender
They were hoping for bloodshed and violence, and that the other would have to surrender

Chronos...the battle time came near

The time was approaching as the intensity grew stronger
When will the battle start?, they asked...how much longer?

As the lamb of God in starking humility approached the proud warrior from the shadows
He reached out his hand and simply offered the proud warrior a rose

And with one blow after another, the proud warrior offered to the crowd a slaying
The crowd cheered in delight; but there remained a handful who dropped to their knees and started praying

The news spread like wildfire; how the proud warrior was victorious and strong
But history would prove this victory wasn’t a victory at all, as the score of this battle was called wrong

Kairos...the battle was not over

The masses continued to follow the proud warrior because they themselves were proud
But the lamb of God had a remnant of believers, and to him they humbly bowed

And together, they sang:

Jesus Rose of Sharon, bloom within my heart.
Bloom in radiance and in love within my heart.
Just As I Am O Lamb Of God
