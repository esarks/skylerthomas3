Song: Named By God
============================================================

Devotional Thought

In Genesis 32, Jacob wrestles through the night with God and emerges with a limp—and a new name: 
Israel
. That name wasn’t given by family, enemies, or his own ambition; it was spoken by God Himself. In Scripture, when God names someone, it reveals identity, calling, and destiny.

Our world is quick to label us—by our past, our mistakes, our accomplishments, or our circumstances. But none of those names carry the authority of the One who knit us together and calls us His own. If you are in Christ, your truest name is “beloved,” “chosen,” “child of God.” His voice over you is the final word, and His word will stand forever.

Today, let that truth silence every other voice. No one gets to name you but God.

Prayer

Father, thank You that You alone have the authority to name me. Thank You for calling me chosen, beloved, and redeemed. Silence every false name spoken over me—names born from fear, shame, or lies—and replace them with the truth of who I am in You.

Just as You renamed Jacob and called him into his destiny, call me again into mine. May I walk in the identity You’ve spoken, confident that You go before me, You are with me, and You will never leave me.

Let my life declare this truth to my family, my community, and the generations to come: No one gets to name me but God. In Jesus’ name, Amen.

Song Lyrics

(Verse 1 – His Voice Over You)
From the start He called you chosen
Every step, His eyes have seen
No label spoken by another
Can erase what God decreed
From the promise to our fathers
To the children yet to come
Every blessing flows from heaven
And your name is on His tongue

(Chorus – Identity Blessing)
No one gets to name you but God
No one gets to claim you but God
He is with you, He goes before you
You are His and His alone
No one gets to name you but God

(Verse 2 – Heaven’s Blessing, Heaven’s Naming)
May His rain fall on your harvest
May His peace be on your home
May His joy fill every moment
May His strength make you whole
He’s the one who called you worthy
He’s the one who called you friend
Every name He speaks is faithful
Every name will stand till the end

(Chorus – Identity Blessing)
No one gets to name you but God
No one gets to claim you but God
He is with you, He goes before you
You are His and His alone
No one gets to name you but God

(Bridge – Generations Called by Name)
May His covenant rest upon you
And a thousand generations
On your children and their children
And their children after them
May His presence go before you
May His angels walk beside you
Every child will bear His blessing
Every child will bear His name
(into repeated refrain)
No one gets to name you but God
No one gets to claim you but God

(Tag – Sung Declaration)
(Leader) Jacob, you are Israel
(People) No one gets to name you but God
(Leader) Beloved, you are mine
(People) No one gets to name you but God
(Leader) Child, I’ve called you by name
(People) No one gets to name you but God

(Final Chorus – Anthem Build)
No one gets to name you but God
No one gets to claim you but God
He is with you, He goes before you
You are His and His alone
No one gets to name you but God

(Outro – Gentle Benediction)
You are not forgotten
You are not forsaken
You are called by name
By the voice of God alone
