Scripture:

"Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you."

— Ephesians 4:32

Walking in the Light of Forgiveness (Devotional):

In our quiet moments of introspection, we may find ourselves facing a familiar silhouette—an echo of the person we once were. The image, outlined by a soft glow, invites us to pause and reflect on the contrasts within us: the friend we nurture and the foe we sometimes become to ourselves. This inner dialogue mirrors our journey with God—a journey from darkness, marked by pain and retaliation, toward a radiant hope defined by forgiveness.

Imagine standing in a dimly lit room, the only guide a shadow that seems at once both foreign and achingly familiar. When we ask, “Who are you?” we may be questioning the remnants of old anger, the wounds that have yet to heal, and the part of us that clings to the law of retaliation—a law that demands an eye for an eye. But God’s call is different. It is a call to remember that there is another way, a path that leads from bitterness to the liberating power of forgiveness.

As the shadow speaks—its words echoing the pain of past transgressions—it also offers a gentle invitation: “There’s another way the Spirit wants you to know.” In that moment, the familiar darkness begins to recede, replaced by the promise of healing. The journey is not without its challenges. At times, the pull toward old habits may feel as if it drags us back into a valley of regret. Yet, with each step, as we walk through the night toward the rising sun, we are reminded that forgiveness is not merely an act of letting go, but an embrace of a new beginning.

From a hilltop, we might see the multitude of faces—friends, family, even strangers—all walking their own paths, each carrying their stories. In the midst of this collective journey, we are gently urged to set aside the daggers of anger and resentment. Instead, we are called to extend grace, to let the warmth of forgiveness melt away the remnants of hurt. This transformation is not instantaneous, but like the slow yet sure ascent of the sun, it promises a new day filled with hope, healing, and reconciliation.

Let this devotional serve as a reminder that our past does not define us. In the light of Christ’s love, we are invited to remember who we truly are—a beloved child of God, capable of extending and receiving forgiveness. Our scars, though reminders of past pain, become testimonies of grace when we allow the Spirit to lead us toward wholeness.

Prayer:

Heavenly Father,
In the quiet of this moment, I open my eyes to the shadows of my past. Help me to see clearly the ways in which old hurts and regrets have shaped me, and grant me the strength to let them go. Lead me on the path of forgiveness and healing, that I may embrace the new beginning You offer. Fill my heart with Your compassion and guide my steps as I walk into the light of Your love. I thank You for Your endless grace and pray that I might extend that same grace to others. In Jesus’ name, Amen.

Writing:

I open my eyes
I see a silhouette outlined by the glow

“Who are you?”
I yell out, “Are you my friend or my foe?”

Emerging from the shadows
I see the likeness of me a long time ago

“Are you lost?” I ask
“Can you remember the direction you should go?”

Then it turns to me
I see the fresh blood from its eye socket flow

“What could this be?”
“Lex Talionis, the Law of Retaliation on me you bestow?”

“An eye for eye?”
“A tooth for a tooth, is this what you think I owe?”

“Is this all I’ve become?”
“Nothing more than the bitter daggers I throw?”

It says to me,
“There’s another way the Spirit wants you to know.”

“You must remember.”
“For that’s the only way forgiveness can let go.”

It reaches for my hand
And drags me through the darkness...at first slow

Faster and faster it pulls
Then turns and says, “You want to get well, no?”

We journey through the night
For miles and miles until we can see the Sun's glow

From the hill above, I look down
I see hundreds, or maybe thousands of people I know

I descend to the valley
Listening to their stories, walking among them to-and-fro

The silhouette walks away, turning back to say,
“Now it’s your time to remember and let forgiveness grow.”

Song:

Verse 1:

I open my eyes, a silhouette in the glow,
A mirror of my past, where doubts and sorrows grow.
“Who are you?” I cry, friend or foe of my soul?
In quiet reflection, I long simply to be whole.

Pre-Chorus:

In stillness of my heart, Your mercy softly calls,
A gentle whisper of grace, breaking down these walls.

Chorus:

Oh, forgiveness grows; let Your shining light come through,
Mending every broken part with a love so true.
As You forgave, oh Lord, help me forgive anew,
In the light of Your mercy, I'm made brand new.

Verse 2:

From the shadows of regret, echoes of pain arise,
Old daggers of retaliation once blinded my eyes.
Yet a voice within the darkness declares, “There’s another way,”
Leading me from bitter nights into the promise of day.

Pre-Chorus:

Every step toward the dawn, Your Spirit guides my way,
Turning scars to testimonies in the warmth of Your ray.

Chorus:

Oh, forgiveness grows; let Your shining light come through,
Mending every broken part with a love so true.
As You forgave, oh Lord, help me forgive anew,
In the light of Your mercy, I'm made brand new.

Bridge:

From a hilltop I behold a multitude of grace,
Every story, every soul, redeemed by Your embrace.
No longer bound by past mistakes or the weight of old regret,
In Your compassion, Lord, I rise—forever unforget

Verse 3:

I descend into the valley where Your truth is all I know,
Listening to hearts set free, where gentle rivers flow.
The shadow fades into the light, and I hear that loving call:
“Remember, let forgiveness grow; in Your love, you have it all.”

Chorus:

Oh, forgiveness grows; let Your shining light come through,
Healing every wounded heart with a love so true.
As You forgave, oh Lord, help me forgive anew,
In the light of Your mercy, I'm made brand new.

Outro:

In the quiet of Your mercy, I rise into the day,
Every burden washed away by the grace You freely say.
Lord, I offer up my heart, in awe of all You do—
Forever singing, “In Your light, I am made new.”
