Song: When the Promise Hurts
============================================================

Inspired by Genesis 16

Song:

Scripture Reading – Genesis 16:7–13 (NIV)

The angel of the Lord found Hagar near a spring in the desert...

And he said, “Hagar, slave of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?”

“I’m running away from my mistress Sarai,” she answered.

Then the angel of the Lord told her, “Go back... I will increase your descendants so much that they will be too numerous to count.”

She gave this name to the Lord who spoke to her: “You are the God who sees me,” for she said, “I have now seen the One who sees me.”

Reflection – “When the Promise Hurts”

There are moments in the life of faith when the very thing we were promised feels more like a burden than a blessing. The waiting stretches on. Silence grows louder. Doubt creeps in.

“When the Promise Hurts”
 is a cry from that sacred in-between — when what God said hasn’t come to pass, and what we’ve done in the meantime has only made things messier. It gives voice to the ache of wondering whether you’ve been forgotten… and the deeper ache of realizing you tried to take control instead of trusting.

The song walks with us through waiting, regret, and fallout — but it doesn't leave us there. It follows the God of Genesis 16, who 
finds us
 in the wilderness, just as He found Hagar. He doesn’t scold. He speaks. He 
names
. He sees.

This is the heart of the gospel: not that we always get it right, but that God still writes mercy into our story. He still moves through the mess. And even when we don’t feel Him, He’s the God who never shuts us out.

So if you’re in a season where the promise hurts — if you’ve made mistakes in the waiting — know this:
You’re not disqualified.
You’re not unseen.
And it’s not over.

The same God who met Hagar in the desert meets you now — with grace, with whisper, with welcome.

Prayer

God of the promise and the wilderness,
You see us when we wait, when we wander, and when we weep.
Forgive us for the ways we’ve tried to force what only You can fulfill.
Forgive us for running from You — or worse, trying to replace You.

Thank You for finding us in the fallout.
Thank You for calling us by name, even when we feel ashamed.
We trust that You still work through the mess.
That You redeem even the pain.
And that You never shut us out.

Teach us to wait well.
To listen for Your whisper.
To follow when You speak.
And to believe again — even when it hurts.

In Jesus’ name,

Amen.

Song: When the Promise Hurts

Verse 1 – The Struggle of Waiting
I held Your promise like a seed in dry ground
Prayed for rain but no mercy came down
I smiled through the silence, held back the tears
But doubt moved in louder with every year
I heard every echo, searched stars for a sign
Wondered if waiting meant I'd been denied
Am I the forgotten, the one You let go?
Or is there still hope in a promise so slow?

Chorus – Confession &amp; Faithfulness
When the promise hurts and I’m breaking inside
When hope’s hanging on by the thinnest line
I’m sorry I ran, sorry I tried
To carry what only You provide
But even in silence, even in doubt
You’re still the God who never shuts me out

Verse 2 – The Fallout
I moved too fast when I should’ve stood still
I pushed the door open and called it Your will
I passed off the burden I didn’t release
And covered the chaos with counterfeit peace
Now I see the cracks in the things I’ve done
The distance I built when I tried to outrun
Can mercy still reach what I’ve torn apart?
Can grace find a way back into my heart?

Chorus – Confession &amp; Faithfulness
When the promise hurts and I’m breaking inside
When hope’s hanging on by the thinnest line
I’m sorry I ran, sorry I tried
To carry what only You provide
But even in silence, even in doubt
You’re still the God who never shuts me out

Verse 3 – Wilderness Grace
You found me alone in the hush of the night
Where the questions were louder than any light
You spoke to the fear I had hidden for years
And called me by name through the weight of my tears
No thunder, no fire — just whisper and breath
A promise not broken, just not finished yet
You meet me right here in the wild unknown
Still calling me chosen, still calling me home

Bridge – Redemption &amp; Release
You don’t ignore all the wrongs I've done
But You weave Your mercy through every one
If You still move in the mess I’ve made
Then even the pain has a part to play

Final Chorus – Restored Trust
When the promise waits and the answer’s delayed
Still I’ll trust You’re working in unseen ways
I’m done with the fight, done with the fear
Your whisper is stronger than all I could hear
And even in silence, even in doubt
You’re still the God who never shuts me out

Outro – Quiet Benediction
You found me afraid, but You called me by name
You stayed through the silence, You stayed through the shame
You never let go, through the silence and doubt
You’re still the God who never shuts me out
