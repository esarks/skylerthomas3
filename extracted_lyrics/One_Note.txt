Here is a devotional based on unity in the church:

One Body, One Spirit

Scripture:

"There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to one hope when you were called; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all."
 — Ephesians 4:4-6 (NIV)

Devotional Thought

The church is meant to be one—unified, not uniform. Just as a pianist plays many notes to create a masterpiece, God has created each of us uniquely, with different gifts, personalities, and callings. And yet, in His divine plan, He calls us to be one body, working together in harmony.

Alone, a single note can be beautiful, but when played in concert with others, it becomes part of a greater symphony. Likewise, we as believers can accomplish much on our own, but our true strength and purpose are revealed when we work together in the unity of Christ.

Paul reminds us in Ephesians 4 that we share the same Spirit, the same faith, and the same Lord. Our unity does not come from being identical, but from being aligned in purpose—glorifying God and sharing His love with the world. Just as a pianist must listen to the other musicians, adjusting and blending to create harmony, we must also be willing to listen to one another, bear with one another, and work together for God’s kingdom.

When we embrace unity, we reflect the beauty of God’s design for His church. Together, we become more than just individual notes—we become His masterpiece.

Prayer

Heavenly Father,
Thank You for calling us into Your family as one body in Christ. Help us to embrace our unique gifts while working together in unity. Give us patience and love for one another so that we may reflect Your glory in the world. May we be like notes in Your divine composition, creating a symphony of grace, truth, and love. Let our unity be a testimony to those who do not yet know You, drawing them closer to Your heart. In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen.

Writing:

I am one…I am one of many…
Yet different from every other…See me?
There I am…
No not there…one over…
Yes…that’s me…Even though I may look the same as many others…
I am very unique, as one of many…

I have an endless number of characteristics…
I can be loud…
I can be soft…
I can be restrained…
I can be sustained…

As One…
I can stand alone…
But that’s not where I do my best work…
For alone, even with all of my endless characteristics…
I am but One Note…

But in the masters hands…
One…and another one…and another…and another…
Together, each with our own endless number of characteristics…
Combined…
Blended…
At the right time…
With the right tempo…
With the right mood…
We become…
One Opus…

Song: One Opus (We Are One)

(Verse 1)

I am one, yet not alone,

A single note, a whispered tone.

A voice that longs to rise and sing,

A melody for Christ my King.

(Chorus)

One voice! (One voice!) One song! (One song!)

One heart where we belong.

One Spirit moves,

One faith, one hope, one love.

(Verse 2)

Hearts united, hand in hand,

Anchored strong in love that stands.

Different voices, yet one sound,

Grace sustains, and hope is found.

(Chorus)

One voice! (One voice!) One song! (One song!)

One heart where we belong.

One Spirit moves,

One faith, one hope, one love.

(Verse 3)

Like the notes upon the keys,

Each one plays a melody.

Every thread and every line,

Woven in His grand design.

(Bridge - A Cappella Friendly)

Oh, we rise, our voices soar,

Bound in love forevermore.

Every sorrow, every praise,

All in Christ, one song we raise.

(Chorus - Repeat)

One voice! (One voice!) One song! (One song!)

One heart where we belong.

One Spirit moves,

One faith, one hope, one love.

(Outro)

One Father’s hands, one love divine,

In Christ forever intertwined.

One people rise, one kingdom strong,

Forever singing—one voice, one song.
