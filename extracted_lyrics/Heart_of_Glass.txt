Devotional: "The Heart of Glass"

Scripture

"And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh."

— Ezekiel 36:26

Reflection

This poem beautifully captures the human desire to protect and perfect our hearts. We search for strength and resilience in many forms—like glass, clay, and granite—seeking a heart that can endure life’s trials without breaking. Yet, time and experience teach us an important truth: it’s not the hardness or durability of our hearts that matters most but their openness to love, vulnerability, and God’s shaping hand.

A heart of glass, though fragile, reflects beauty and light in a way that no stone can. When we attempt to make our hearts impenetrable, like granite, we may succeed in avoiding hurt, but we also close ourselves off from love and connection. A cold, hard heart isolates us, leaving us lonely and distant from others. On the other hand, a heart too brittle—like one made of clay—may crumble under pressure, leaving us feeling useless or defeated.

The lesson here is not about finding the perfect material for our hearts but about trusting the right Artist. The Master Craftsman, our Creator, forms each of us with love, care, and purpose. He knows the balance between beauty and strength, between fragility and endurance. He shapes our hearts not to be invulnerable but to reflect His character—tender, compassionate, and full of grace.

A glass heart, though it may seem fragile, carries a unique kind of strength. It requires humility to handle it carefully, acknowledging that we cannot protect it alone. When we entrust our hearts to God, we don’t have to fear breaking. Even if our hearts do shatter under life’s pressures, God, in His mercy, gathers the pieces and creates something even more beautiful. His closeness to the brokenhearted ensures that no wound is beyond His ability to heal.

This devotional reminds us that our hearts are best shared with humility, not pride. They are not meant to be displayed as trophies for all the world to see but to be vessels of love and light, handled with care and offered to God and others. When we allow God to shape and guide our hearts, we find the balance between vulnerability and resilience, discovering a beauty that comes only from Him.

Prayer

Heavenly Father,
Thank You for being the Master Craftsman of my heart. You know its every detail, its strengths, its weaknesses, and its capacity for love. Forgive me when I try to harden my heart to protect myself or when I let my pride display it carelessly, leaving it vulnerable to harm.

Teach me to trust You fully with my heart, knowing that even in its fragility, Your strength is sufficient. Help me to handle my heart with humility, recognizing that it is a reflection of Your love and grace. May I share it with others in ways that glorify You, shining Your light through its transparency. And when life’s pressures cause my heart to break, remind me that You are near, ready to restore and renew me with Your loving hands.

Shape me into the person You’ve called me to be, Lord. May my heart always reflect Your beauty, compassion, and purpose.
Amen.

Writing

The glassblower formed the molten glow
His skill refined and keen
With the care of an artist creating perfection
It was the prettiest heart I’d ever seen

I took my heart and showed it with pride
For all the world to see
But it was too fragile, this heart of glass
And a broken heart’s of no use to me

I searched far and wide for the best potter
To make a heart that was stronger
It wasn’t as pretty, this heart of clay
But I knew it would last longer

I took my heart and showed it with pride
For all the world to see
It too was fragile and it crumbled
And a broken heart’s of no use to me

To the best sculptor money could buy
I found my heart of granite
It was heavy and hard, not very pretty
This strongest heart on the planet

I took my heart and showed it with pride
For all the world to see
It didn’t break, but it was too cold
And all those around left me

The glassblower formed the molten glow
His skill refined and keen
With the care of an artist creating perfection
It was the prettiest heart I’d ever seen

I took my heart, handling it with care
For some of the world to see
This heart of glass, fragile in its beauty
Is best shared with humility

Mold My Heart

Verse 1

Open my heart, Lord, shape it anew,
Fill it with love that flows from You.
Teach me to see through others’ pain,
And show me how to love again.

Verse 2

Break down my pride, Lord, soften my soul,
Help me to see where love makes whole.
Guide me to serve, to give, to share,
And show Your kindness everywhere.

Chorus

Mold my heart, O Lord, to follow Your way,
Shape me with love, teach me how to obey.
Help me to love, forgive, and believe,
To offer Your hope to those in need.
Strengthen my steps, make my purpose clear,
Let me reflect that You are near.

Verse 3

Fill me with grace, Lord, let it shine,
A heart that beats with love divine.
Lead me to those who need Your care,
And teach me compassion everywhere.

Bridge

Tear down my walls, Lord, set me free,
Make me the person You want me to be.
Fill me with grace, Your Spirit within,
Transform my heart, let Your work begin.
Restore the hurting, lift up the weak,
Through every moment, Your will I seek.

Verse 4

Plant seeds of love within my heart,
Help me to live and do my part.
Let every act and every word,
Reflect Your truth, let it be heard.

Chorus

Mold my heart, O Lord, to follow Your way,
Shape me with love, teach me how to obey.
Help me to love, forgive, and believe,
To offer Your hope to those in need.
Strengthen my steps, make my purpose clear,
Let me reflect that You are near.

Outro

Mold my heart, Lord, refine it still,
Align my life with Your perfect will.
Let love flow out in all that I do,
A living reflection of only You.
In every word, in every song,
Let my heart declare where I belong.
