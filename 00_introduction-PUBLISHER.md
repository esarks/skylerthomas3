# Out of the Swamp: How I Found Truth

## Introduction

---

### The Wayfarer's Anthem

*I used to think love was something I earned. Then I met it in a swamp. Covered in mud, gasping for air, convinced I was too far gone—that's when I felt it. Not a rescue that pulled me out immediately, but a presence that sat with me in the muck and whispered, "I'm here. I've been here the whole time. And I'm not leaving."*

## Who This Book Is For

Are you soul tired? The kind of tired that sleep doesn't fix.

Do you lie awake wondering if there's more than this? Do achievements feel hollow? Relationships exhausting? Does the constant striving to prove you're enough never... quite... work?

If that resonates, keep reading.

Because I've discovered another way to live. Not perfect. Not easy. But different. Better. More real.

And you don't have to figure it out alone.

## What This Book Really Is

Let me be honest: this is a book about finding something more. That "something more" is a spiritual connection—but probably not the kind you're thinking of.

This isn't about religion or joining a church. But yes, I'm going to talk about God. About Jesus. About ancient wisdom from the Bible. Because these texts and thinkers have mapped this journey before us.

**If you've never been to church**, you might have an advantage—fewer bad experiences to unlearn.

**If you walked away years ago**, I get it. The institution fails people. But this isn't about going back to what hurt you.

**If you're not sure you even believe**, stick with me. I'm not asking you to sign a statement of faith. I'm inviting you to consider: *What if there's a Love that meets you exactly where you are? What if you don't have to clean yourself up first? What if the brokenness you're carrying is the exact place where healing begins?*

### Why "Spirituality" Not "Religion"

**Religion says:** Follow the rules, perform well, measure up, and maybe you'll be acceptable.

**Spirituality says:** You're already known. Already seen. Already loved. Now come find out what that means.

I talk about **God** not as a distant force or angry judge, but as the source of love you've been searching for. The kind that doesn't depend on your performance. That doesn't quit when you mess up. That runs toward you, not away.

I talk about **Jesus** not as a religious figure on stained glass, but as God stepping into human skin. To live our life. To feel our pain. To show us what Love looks like with hands and feet. He didn't come to start a religion. He came for people who were drowning—people like us.

I talk about **the Spirit** as God's actual presence that can live in you. That whispers truth when you're believing lies. That gives strength when you have none. That transforms from the inside out.

**Why would this matter to you?**

Maybe you've tried everything else. Achieving your way to meaning. Working harder. Finding the right relationship. Filling the void with whatever you could find. Being a better person through sheer willpower.

And if you're honest, it's all come up short.

Not because you're doing it wrong. But because you were designed for something deeper. Something that doesn't break when life breaks.

Augustine said it: *"Our hearts are restless until they rest in You."*

That restlessness? That's not a flaw. That's your soul telling you there's something real to find.

## The Crash

You know that moment when you can't keep pretending anymore?

For me, it came in eight words: *"I can't do this anymore."*

Then my world crumbled.

It was more than burnout. It was moral breakdown—an unraveling of the life I'd tried to hold together. My performance-based identity collapsed. I crossed boundaries those closest to me couldn't accept. As leader, husband, father—I lost the trust that defined my identity.

What remained? Shame. Emptiness. And the desperate hope that I could still be loved.

**But here's what I discovered:**

Love meets us exactly where we are. Not where we should be. Not where we pretend to be. Exactly where we are—mud and all.

### The Years of Performance

Everything looked right from the outside. Working hard. Mentoring. Serving community. Being a good family man. People looked to me as an example.

But underneath? Relationships fracturing. Conflicts I couldn't navigate. My boss pulled me aside: the dynamic wasn't working, and I was part of the problem. At home, tension you could feel before anyone spoke.

I was trying so hard. But internally? Drowning.

Then the facade crumbled.

And the institution I'd served so faithfully? They didn't know how to handle brokenness. No resources for restoration. Only consequences. Instead of healing, I heard condemnation. Instead of compassion, rejection.

So I walked away. Into the swamp of shame, isolation, and despair.

Henri Nouwen named what I was experiencing:

> "There is a deep hole in your being, like an abyss. You will never succeed in filling that hole, because your needs are inexhaustible... Since the hole is so deep and your anguish so total, you run away from it, afraid that you will fall into it."
>
> — Henri Nouwen, *The Inner Voice of Love*

That abyss—I'd spent years trying to fill it with performance, approval, image-maintenance. But in the swamp, I was too tired to run. I had to look at it. Face what I'd been avoiding.

Maybe you can't relate to my specific story. But perhaps you know the ending: wounded to the point of wanting out. Standing in wreckage that can't be put back together.

That's where this journey begins. Not in victory, but in the swamp. Not with answers, but with honesty.

## The Journey: Three Movements

This book follows three stages from performance to authenticity, from drowning to dancing, from swamp to sustainable life.

### Movement 1: The Swamp

Where we're stuck. The quicksand of shame. Muck of failure. Waters of despair rising.

This isn't just depression or spiritual dryness. This is the accumulated weight of years performing instead of being. Hollow conversations. Service that felt like work. Community that felt like critique. Meaning that became burden instead of gift.

An ancient writer knew this place:

> *"Save me, O God, for the floodwaters are up to my neck. Deeper and deeper I sink into the mire; I can't find a foothold."*
> — Psalm 69:1-2 (NLT)

Worn out calling for help. That's the swamp.

Until we name the swamp for what it is, we can't imagine leaving it.

### Movement 2: The Water's Edge

The transition space.

You've dragged yourself out of the swamp. Now you're at the edge of something clean. Living water. The kind that refreshes. Quenches real thirst.

But you're terrified to step in.

Why? Because you're filthy. Covered in swamp muck. You're convinced the water will reject you. That you need to clean up first.

This is where love does its most subversive work. Where you discover the invitation isn't "Clean yourself up and then come."

It's "Come as you are, and restoration will find you."

### Movement 3: Unforced Rhythms of Life

Life after surrender. Not perfection, but participation. Not arrival, but walking.

An ancient invitation speaks to this:

> *"Come to me, all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest... For my yoke is easy to bear, and the burden I give you is light."*
> — Matthew 11:28-30 (NLT)

Picture someone who's learned to float. Still in the water, but no longer fighting it. No longer exhausting yourself trying to stay afloat through sheer effort. Learning to rest in the water that holds you.

The unforced rhythms are about becoming apprentices—not of a religious system, but of a way of life. Learning to live sustainably, authentically, in the flow of grace rather than the grind of performance.

## The Songs as Waypoints

Each chapter centers on a song.

These aren't illustrations—they're the heart of it. Each song was written in a specific season, in a specific struggle, and became a waypoint on the journey. The book is the story behind the songs. The songs are the soundtrack of healing.

When you reach each chapter, listen first, read second. Let the music bypass your defenses and touch the ache directly. Then we'll unpack it together.

The ancient Psalms taught me this. They're not theological treatises set to music. They're prayers that became songs. Laments that became worship. Honest cries that became sacred text.

David didn't write about crying out in the cave. He cried out, and that cry became a psalm.

These songs are my psalms: imperfect, incomplete, but honest.

And honesty is where healing begins.

## The Scandal of Love in the Muck

Throughout this book, I'll use the word "scandal" often. Here's why:

A scandal breaks the rules. Violates expectations. Makes people uncomfortable because it doesn't fit the system they've built.

**The scandal is this:** In every system humans create, love has conditions. Acceptance has requirements. Forgiveness has limits.

But love doesn't have to work that way.

Love says:
- "I love you when you're covered in swamp mud."
- "I forgive you before you've proven you've changed."
- "I call you 'beloved' when you're still a mess."
- "I meet you in the muck and call it holy ground."

This offends our sense of fairness. Breaks every rule about how love should work. **That's the scandal.**

If you could earn it, it wouldn't be free—it would be payment.
If you deserved it, it wouldn't be love—it would be obligation.
If you had to clean up first, it wouldn't be scandalous—it would be sensible.

But love doesn't do sensible. Love does scandalous.

**Love doesn't wait for you to clean up. It wades into the muck with you.**

An ancient truth captures this: *"Love shows itself in this: While we were still broken, restoration came for us."*

While we were still. Not after we cleaned up. Not once we got our act together.

**While we were still.** In the swamp. In the muck. In the middle of our mess.

## The Wayfarer Identity

Who is a wayfarer? Someone on a journey, often weary. A pilgrim. A traveler.

Not someone who has arrived, but someone honest enough to admit they're still on the road. Not perfect, but willing to keep walking.

Wayfarers know:
- The road is long and we're not there yet
- We'll walk through swamps, deserts, and dark valleys
- We don't travel alone
- The point isn't arrival; it's learning to walk authentically
- Questions are allowed, doubt is part of the journey
- We're all just beggars telling other beggars where to find bread

One teacher describes this path:

> "The spiritual life is not a life of success but a life of faithfulness. It's not about never falling, but about getting back up. It's not about perfection, but about direction."
> — Richard Rohr, *Falling Upward*

## The Road Ahead

Picture a traveler at the beginning of a long road.

Pack on their back. Mud on their boots. Questions in their hearts.

They don't know exactly where the road leads. They don't know how long it will take.

But they know two things:

1. They can't stay in the swamp.
2. They don't have to walk alone.

Augustine wrote: *"You have made us for yourself, O Lord, and our hearts are restless until they rest in you."*

That restlessness is mercy. It's your soul refusing to settle for substitutes, calling you out of the swamp and onto the road.

So we begin. Not with answers, but with honesty. Not with arrival, but with willingness to walk.

The journey is long. But love is real.

**The Wayfarer's Anthem:** I can't do this alone. But I don't have to.

Let's walk together.
